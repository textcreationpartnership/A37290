            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE <hi>CHRISTIAN READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOU haſt here <hi>(Chriſtian Reader) An Expoſition of the Book of the Prophet Iſaiah:</hi> The Endeavours of one, who is conſcious to himſelf of his own weakneſſe, upon him, who, as He is the moſt <hi>Eloquent,</hi> ſo is He the moſt <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall</hi> of all the Prophets. But what He did, He did for his own uſe, and the uſe of his own Children, (if it ſhould pleaſe God to bring them to the yeares of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) without any thought of publiſhing it to the world. But being perſwaded thereunto by friends, He hath now made it publique: And if it may prove any way beneficiall to thee, or profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to any one, whoſoever he be, which deſireth the knowledge of the Scriptures, it ſhall not repent him.</p>
            <p>I called our Prophet, as the moſt <hi>Eloquent;</hi> So the moſt <hi>Evangelicall</hi> of all the Prophets: For</p>
            <p>Our Prophet hath many excellent Propheſies of Chriſt, and of thoſe things which are contained in the Goſpel: And our Saviour and his Apoſtles have more Quotations concerning the Goſpel, and contents thereof, out of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> than they have out of any one, nay, I may ſay, out of all the other fifteen Prophets beſides.</p>
            <p>Yet know, that the Goſpel, and the contents thereof, was a Myſterie, and was hidden untill theſe latter dayes, <hi>in which God ſpoke unto us by his Sonne;</hi> Hence the Apoſtle calls the Goſpel, <hi>The wiſdome of God in a Myſtery, even the hidden wiſdome,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7. Hence he calls it alſo, <hi>The Myſtery of his will,</hi> Eph. 1.9. And <hi>the Myſtery of the Goſpel,</hi> Eph. 6.19. And <hi>the Myſtery of God, and of the Father, and of Chriſt,</hi> Coloſ. 2.2. And <hi>a Myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the world began,</hi> Rom. 16.25. And <hi>a Myſtery which had been hid from Ages and Generations, but now made manifeſt to the Saints,</hi> Col. 1.26.</p>
            <p>I know that many underſtand this laſt place, not of the whole Goſpel, but of part onely of it, namely of the <hi>calling of the Gentiles:</hi> But ſurely, if the <hi>calling of the Gentiles</hi> was a Myſtery which had been hid from Ages and Generations, what part of the Goſpel was not hidden? For to goe no farther than our own Prophet, what Propheſie was more frequent; what more plain (if any part of the Propheſies concerning the Goſpel was plain) than that of the calling of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>

               <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe in the laſt dayes, that the Mountain of the Lords houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the Mountaines, and ſhall be exalted above the Hills, and all Nations ſhall flow unto it, and many People ſhall goe and ſay, Come yee, and let us goe up to the Mountain of the Lord, to the Houſe of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and He will teach us of his wayes, and we will walk in his paths: For out of</hi> Zion <hi>ſhall goe forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>and He ſhall judge among the Nations,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 2. verſ. 2, 3, 4. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a root of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>which ſhall ſtand for an Enſigne of the People; To it ſhall the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſeek, and His reſt ſhall be glorious,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 11. verſ. 10. <hi>In that day ſhall five Cities in the Land of</hi> Aegypt <hi>ſpeak the Language of</hi> Canaan, <hi>and ſwear to the Lord of Hoſts; One ſhall be called the City of Deſtruction. In that day ſhall there be an Altar to the Lord in the Land of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and a Pillar in the border thereof to the Lord: And it ſhall be for a ſigne and for a witneſſe unto the Lord of Hoſts in the Land of</hi> Aegypt: <hi>And the Lord ſhall be known to</hi> Aegypt, <hi>and the</hi> Aegyptians <hi>ſhall know the Lord,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 19. verſ. 18, 19, 20. <hi>It is a light thing that thou ſhouldſt be my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to raiſe up the Tribes of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and to reſtore the preſerved of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>I will alſo give Thee for a light to the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>that Thou mayſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the earth,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 49. verſ. 6. <hi>The Iſles ſhall wait upon me, and on my Name ſhall they truſt,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 51. verſ. 5. <hi>Behold my Servant ſhall ſprinkle many Nations, the Kings ſhall ſhut their mouthes at Him: For that which had not been told them ſhall they ſee, and that which they had not heard ſhall they conſider,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 52. verſ. 15. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David, Iſaiah Cap. 55. verſ. 8. <hi>The abundance of the Sea ſhall be converted unto Thee, the Forces of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>ſhall come unto Thee, &amp;c.</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 60. verſ. 5. &amp;c. <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me, I am found of them that ſought Me not: I ſaid, behold me; behold me, unto a Nation that was not called by my Name,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 65. verſ. 1. <hi>It ſhall come to paſſe, that from one new Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, ſhall all fleſh come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before me, ſaith the Lord,</hi> Iſaiah Cap. 60. verſ. 21. All theſe are Propheſies concerning the calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and I know no Propheſies concerning the Goſpel, more plentifull, and more plain than theſe are:</p>
            <p>If therefore (notwithſtanding theſe and many the like Propheſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) the calling of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> was a Myſtery hidden from Ages and Generations, then certainly other parts of the Goſpel were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den too, eſpecially if we ſpeak of the <hi>diſtinct knowledge</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But you will ſay, the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt, and many <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors, had knowledge of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> before the dayes of the Goſpel; and underſtood many places of the Scriptures of the old Teſtament of the <hi>Meſsiah;</hi> ſo that they very well knew the Goſpel, for what is the Goſpel but the Hiſtory of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> that is, the Hiſtory of Chriſt, and the benefits by him received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſt, and other <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Doctors believed, that the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> was to come (having received it ſome way or other) and having more than ordinary conceits of him, underſtood many eminent places of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Meſsiah:</hi> But yet they were farre from the knowledge of the <hi>Goſpel;</hi> For they underſtood little more of the <hi>Meſsiah</hi> than his name; for they were altogether ignorant of his divine Nature, and his Offices: And though they thought that he ſhould be a King, yet they thought that he ſhould be but a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall King, ſo that they knew not the true Benefits, and true Redemption, and Salvation which is wrought by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which whoſoever knoweth not, muſt needs be ignorant of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But yet you will ſay, How was the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hidden ſo long, when as the Prophets and holy Men of the Lord ſpoke of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (all, or many parts thereof in the dayes of old?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Although the Prophets and holy Men of the Lord ſpoke of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (all, or many parts thereof) in the dayes of old, yet notwithſtanding, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> was accounted as a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> and as a thing hidden from former Ages and Generations, becauſe they did either ſpeak of it in Parables, and dark Speeches, and Allegories, or becauſe they ſpoke of it under the Types and ſhadowes of other things: And under the Types and ſhadowes of other things doth our Prophet ſpeak of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> (and the glorious things therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) when he propheſieth of it; For he propheſieth firſt of things to come in times nearer to his own times: And by theſe things doth he propheſie of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and glorious things therein. And this, or from this (as I conceive) is that vail which, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, remaineth upon the minds of the <hi>Jewes</hi> untaken away, in the reading of the Old Teſtament, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Cor,</hi> 3.14. For if they underſtand the Literal and Hiſtoricall ſenſe of the Scriptures, they look no farther: They will not look at thoſe things which are figured by the <hi>Hiſtory;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Hiſtoricall</hi> ſenſe is as a <hi>vail</hi> before their eyes, and hindereth them from beholding thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things which are covered with that <hi>vaile,</hi> and which lie wrapped up in the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> as in a <hi>Type.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that <hi>vaile is done away in Chriſt,</hi>

            <p>

            <p>I ſhall illuſtrate and prove what I have ſaid concerning theſe five Notes or Obſervations, before I proceed any further.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> thing that I would have notice taken of was, that many places of theſe holy Writers of the Old Teſtament, and eſpecially of the Prophets, carry with them a double ſenſe; One concerning terrene and corporall things, and things to come to paſſe before the dayes of the <hi>Meſsiah:</hi> Another concerning ſpirituall and heavenly things, and things which are not to come to paſſe before the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi>'s coming.</p>
            <p>Such a double ſenſe we read of in the Law; For it is <hi>written in the Law, that</hi> Abraham <hi>had two Sonnes, the one by a Bond-maid, the other by a Free-woman: And he that was of the Bond-wonan was born after the fleſh; and he that was of the Free-woman was by promiſe:</hi> Here is one ſence plain: Now beſides this, there is in theſe words another ſenſe; For theſe two women ſignifie the two Covenants, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. verſ. 22, 23, 24. So what is written <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. tells us of the killing of the Paſſeover, and all the Rites and Ceremonies thereto belonging: And that is one ſenſe of the Chapter: But beſides that, there is another ſenſe therein contained; for the Paſſeover ſignifieth Chriſt, and his killing Chriſt's ſuffering: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 7. So <hi>Pſalm</hi> 109. in one ſenſe <hi>David</hi> complaineth of his enemies: In another ſenſe he propheſieth how wickedly Chriſt ſhould be dealt withall: <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. And here in this book our Prophet propheſieth of the wicked <hi>Iewes,</hi> that they ſhould be ſo deſtroyed by the ſword of their enemies, as that a very ſmall Remnant of them ſhould be left; and that is one ſenſe of the 7, 8, and 9. verſes of the firſt Chapter, and yet in that very ſame place he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſieth and foretells, that <hi>many ſhould periſh through unbelief,</hi> ſo that <hi>few onely ſhould be ſaved. Rom.</hi> 9.29. So <hi>Cap.</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 3, 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c</hi> He propheſieth of the <hi>Lords</hi> coming to ſave the <hi>Iewes</hi> from the fury of the <hi>Aſſyrians:</hi> And yet he foretells in that very place of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming in the fleſh, to ſave us from our ſinnes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.5.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing which I would have notice taken of is this; That the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe (where the two aforeſaid ſenſes are to be found) in the holy Writs of the Old Teſtament, is ſignified diſtinctly, plainly,
<pb facs="tcp:101476:4"/> and immediately, by the words of theſe holy Writers: But the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, is not ſignified diſtinctly, plainly, and immediately by their words, but as it were onely in groſſe and mediately, that is, by thoſe things which are ſignified diſtinctly, plainly, and immediately, by their words.</p>
            <p>In the Law this is evident; For the words thereof doe plainly, and diſtinctly, and immediately, ſet forth unto us the ſtory of <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar, Gen. Cap.</hi> 16. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 21. But they doe not ſo ſet forth the matter of the two Covenants therein contained; but they are ſignified not immediately by the words of that Story, but by the things ſignified by thoſe words, <hi>to wit,</hi> by <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,</hi> the former whereof ſignified the <hi>New,</hi> the latter the <hi>Old Covenant; Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 24. So in the matter of the Paſſeover, that which concerneth the Paſſeover is diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, plainly, and immediately ſet down by thoſe words which we read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. But as for that which concerneth <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that <hi>Chapter,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7.) that is not ſignified by the words thereof; but by that which was immediately ſignified by thoſe words, <hi>that is,</hi> by the Paſſeover it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For example ſake, whereas it it ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.8. That <hi>the fleſh of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſhall be roaſt with fire, and eaten with bitter hearbs;</hi> How can theſe words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſignifie any thing in or about Chriſt? But though theſe words cannot immediately ſignifie any thing in or about Chriſt; yet that may, which is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſignified by thoſe words; for that the <hi>Paſſeover</hi> ſhould be roaſted with fire, and eaten with bitter hearbs, may ſignifie, the cruell and bitter death which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſuffer.</p>
            <p>So in the Book of <hi>Joſhua</hi> it is recorded word by word, how <hi>Joſhua</hi> brought the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were redeemed out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the ſame Story containes <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his bringing the Church of the Redeemed into the heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Kingdome of God: But this is not ſignified word by word as the Acts of <hi>Ioſhua</hi> are; but this is ſignified by the Acts of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> which were ſignified word by word in that Book.</p>
            <p>And as in the Law, ſo in this our Prophet have we frequent examples of this thing. For in that he propheſied, that a Remnant of the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould be ſaved, and that they ſhould not be quite cut off from being a Nation, neither when <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould oppreſſe them, and make a great havock of them, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Nor when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> ſhould invade <hi>Iudah,</hi> and make a great deſtruction and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein, <hi>Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, &amp;c. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 21, 22, 23, &amp;c. He propheſied, that though many ſhould periſh eternally, yet a <hi>remnant</hi> ſhould be eternally ſaved, <hi>according to the election of Grace by Chriſt Ieſus, Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 29. and 11.5. But yet when he propheſied, that a remnant ſhould be eternally ſaved, according to the election of Grace by <hi>Chriſt Ieſus,</hi> he propheſied of that not in formall words immediately word by word; but by thoſe things which he propheſied of immediately word by word in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall words, <hi>that is,</hi> by the Temporall ſalvation of thoſe, which ſhould be ſaved from the ſword, in the dayes of <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> firſt, and in the dayes of <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> afterwards, which were they which remained in <hi>Hieruſalem.</hi> So in that he propheſied of the happineſſe and joy which ſhould be upon the deſtruction of <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s Army, <hi>Cap.</hi> 25. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. And the joy and glory which <hi>Sion</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſhould enjoy after their delivery out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, <hi>Cap.</hi> 60. throughout the whole Chapter. He propheſied o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he joy, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and glory, which the Church of the Redeemed in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, after that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had deſtroyed the works of the Devil, and triumphed over
<pb facs="tcp:101476:5"/> Principalities and Powers, and delivered his choſen Ones out of their hands, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 55. <hi>Rev.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 17. and 21. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 25. and 3. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. <hi>v</hi> 22. and 22. <hi>v.</hi> 5. Yet when he propheſied of the joy, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and glory, which the Church of the Redeemed in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhould enjoy, after the deſtruction of the workes of the <hi>Devill,</hi> &amp;c. he propheſied not of them immediately by words, but mediately, <hi>that is,</hi> by the things ſignified by thoſe words, that is, by that temporall joy, and temporall and carnall bleſſings, which the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould enjoy, after the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> firſt, and the <hi>Babylonians</hi> afterwards, and their delivery out of the hands of thoſe their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> thing that I deſired ſhould be taken notice of was, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the <hi>Second,</hi> or <hi>Myſticall,</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe is not diſtinctly, plainly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſignified, by the words of thoſe holy Writers; but as it were onely in <hi>groſſe</hi> and <hi>mediately, that is,</hi> by thoſe things which are ſignified diſtinctly, plainly, and immediately by their words; yet there be in many Hiſtories (as I may call them) and Propheſies, of thoſe holy Writers, ſometimes one, ſometimes more ſentences, which ſignifie immediately by their words, not onely ſome paſſage, or paſſages, which appertain to the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> and <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe: But alſo ſome paſſage, or paſſages, which appertain to the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe. We ſhall find examples of this in the <hi>Law;</hi> for <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 46. It is ſaid of the <hi>Paſchall Lamb, Neither ſhall yee break a bone thereof;</hi> And this ſentence is not onely underſtood of the <hi>Paſchall Lamb,</hi> but it is alſo underſtood of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is figured by the <hi>Paſchall Lamb;</hi> and that <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>John</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 36. So 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 14. It is ſaid by God of <hi>Solomon, I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Sonne;</hi> But this is not to be underſtood of <hi>Solomon</hi> onely, but of <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo, of whom <hi>Solomon</hi> is there a Type, and that immediately too by the words, <hi>Hebrewes</hi> 1.5. And as there, ſo in our Prophet, the words of the Prophet are ſo often directed, and ordered by the Holy Ghoſt, as that many ſentences doe not onely ſignifie ſome paſſages concerning the Type, but alſo ſome paſſages concerning the Antitype too, and that by their words immediately: For what we read, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 9, <hi>Except the Lord of Hoſtes had left us a very ſmall remnant, we ſhould have been left as</hi> Sodome, <hi>and we ſhould have been like unto</hi> Gomorrah, is literally underſtood, of the mercy of God in reſerving a few <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> from the deſtruction and deſolation, which <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould make of the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And it is not onely underſtood immediately by the letter, of the mercy of God, in reſerving a few <hi>Jewes</hi> in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> from the deſtruction and deſolation which <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſhould make of the <hi>Jewes:</hi> But alſo of the mercy of God, in ſaving a <hi>remnant, according to the election of grace,</hi> from everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, Rom.</hi> 9.29.

I ſhall not need to bring any more examples of this; for they which ſhall read this our Expoſition, may have the opportunity to obſerve many Notes of this kind (as of the others alſo which I have propounded.)</p>
            <p>But it may be objected againſt theſe Obſervations, and asked here. If the Word of God carry <hi>a double ſenſe</hi> with it; and the ſentences of the Scripture may have a <hi>double meaning;</hi> are they not like the Oracles of the Devill, which carried a <hi>double ſenſe,</hi> and had with them a <hi>double meaning?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> God forbid: For firſt, the Oracles of the Devill, though they had a <hi>double</hi> meaning, and carried a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe with them, yet their <hi>double</hi> meaning, and <hi>double</hi> ſenſe, was concerning one and the ſame thing: But the Word of God, where it hath a <hi>double</hi> meaning, or a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe, relateth not to one and the ſame thing, but to ſeverall things, whereof one is as the Type and Figure of the other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though the Word of God doth carry a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe with it in many places, yet is each part of the ſenſe determined to its proper ſubject, and not left in ſuſpenſe, and doubtfull; But the <hi>double</hi> ſenſe which the Oracles of the Devill had, were not determined to any one truth, but left in ſuſpenſe, and doubtfull, that the Devill, upon the Event of the thing, of which he gave his Oracle, might apply it as he liſt, to ſave his credit with his followers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>double</hi> ſenſe of the Oracles, which the Devill gave, was contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory the one part thereof to the other; and could not (both parts of it) be poſſibly true in the <hi>event,</hi> becauſe they implied a Contradiction: But though many parts of the Word of God, and many ſentences thereof, doe carry with them a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe, or <hi>double</hi> meaning, yet are both of the ſenſes and meanings true; there is no diſagreeing between them, in that matter: Examples of the Word of God which carry a double ſenſe with them, I have given divers a little before: Now take one inſtance of the Devils Oracles, and by that judge of the reſt.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> King of <hi>Epirus</hi> had a mind to goe to battle againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> he was deſirous to know what ſucceſſe he was like to have before he went to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and therefore asked counſell of <hi>Apollo,</hi> who gave him this anſwer; <hi>Aio te Aeacide Romanos vincere poſſe;</hi> which I render thus; <hi>I ſay that Pyrrhus the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans can overcome;</hi> which anſwer hath a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe, for the ſenſe may be this, that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> can overcome the <hi>Romanes,</hi> or this, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> can overcome <hi>Pyrrhus;</hi> where you ſee <hi>firſt,</hi> that this <hi>double</hi> ſenſe is concerning one and the ſame ſubject. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the ſenſe is not determined, but left in ſuſpenſe, and doubtfull, for he doth not determine whither <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> can overcome the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Romans Pyrrhus.</hi> And <hi>thirdly,</hi> One part of the ſenſe is contradictory to the other, and therefore cannot both parts be true in the <hi>event;</hi> For if it be true, that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> can vanquiſh the <hi>Romans,</hi> then cannot it be true, that the <hi>Romans</hi> can vanquiſh <hi>Pyrrhus.</hi> And if it be true, that the <hi>Romans</hi> can vanquiſh <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be true, that <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> can vanquiſh the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing that I deſired might be taken notice of was, That though in many Hiſtories, and Propheſies, of theſe holy Writers, there be ſometimes one, ſometimes more ſentences, which ſignifie immediately by their words, ſome
<pb facs="tcp:101476:6"/> paſſage, or paſſages, which appertain not onely to the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enſe; But alſo ſome paſſage, or paſſages, which appertain to the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> Senſe; yet the words are not alwayes to be taken after the ſame manner, but ſometimes in a different manner in one, from that in which they were taken in the other ſenſe.</p>
            <p>And this we may ſee illuſtrated and verified by divers examples: The ſixty ninth <hi>Pſalm</hi> was a <hi>Pſalm</hi> which <hi>David</hi> made when he was in diſtreſſe, and therein he complaineth grievouſly of his Enemies, being no doubt in great ſtreights and preſſure at that time: Now as <hi>David</hi> was a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo doth this <hi>Pſalm</hi> (which ſets forth the afflictions of <hi>David</hi>) propheſie of the afflictions and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould ſuffer, while he was on the earth, by the Sonnes of Men: And as the whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the firſt ſence concerneth <hi>David;</hi> ſo in the ſecond and ſublime ſenſe it concerneth <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and ſome particular ſentences are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, acording to the words, as well of <hi>Chriſt</hi> as they are of <hi>David;</hi> but of <hi>David</hi> in a <hi>Proverbiall</hi> and <hi>Figurative,</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in a <hi>proper</hi> kind of ſpeech: For that ſentence, <hi>In my thirſt they gave me vinegar to drink, Verſ.</hi> 21. Is ſpoken of <hi>David</hi> onely figuratively, and in the manner of a Proverb, and ſignifies, that when he had need of comfort they did, in ſtead of comforting him, adde ſorrow to his grief: But it is ſpoken of <hi>Chriſt properly,</hi> and foretels, that his enemies ſhould give him vinegar indeed to drink; and it was fulfilled while he hung upon the Croſſe, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28, 29. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 4. It is written (according to our old Tranſlation, and according to the Septuagint, and according to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s reading, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 18.) <hi>Their ſound is gone out into all Lands, And their words into the ends of the world;</hi> which are ſpoken in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Literall,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe of the Heavens, and that <hi>Metaphorically;</hi> And the Heavens are ſaid to ſound out, and ſpeak the praiſes of God all the world over, becauſe they are ſeen to all the world, to be ſo excellently made, as that men may underſtand thereby the eternall power and God-head of him that made them. But as they are ſpoken in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Literall,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe, of the Heavens <hi>Metaphorically:</hi> So are they ſpoken of the Apoſtles, who preached the Goſpel in all the world, in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, <hi>properly, Rom.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 18. And note here, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth theſe words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in that place of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> not by <hi>Accommodation</hi> onely, <hi>that is,</hi> not becauſe they are words fit for his purpoſe, without any relation to the intent of the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in that place; but he alledgeth them, as words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Prophet <hi>David</hi> (as a man inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt) to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that, for which he there alledgeth them, as he that ſeriouſly conſidereth the Text, and Context, muſt needs confeſſe.</p>
            <p>But if you ask me, how the Prophet <hi>David,</hi> though inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, can ſignifie, by thoſe words in that place, the preaching of the Goſpel by the Apoſtles throughout the world.</p>
            <p>Take theſe my Notions (ſuch as they are) in a place of much difficulty and controverſie.</p>
            <p>The work of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the whole redemption of Man, is as a <hi>new Creation;</hi> and hath reſemblance thereunto intended by the Holy Ghoſt: Hence we read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 1 7. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt he is a new Creature: Old things are paſſed away; behold all things are become new.</hi> And <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumciſion, nor Uncircumciſion, availeth any thing, but a new Creature.</hi> The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> therefore, while he ſpeakes of the Heavens, which is the higheſt, and lighteſt, and chiefeſt part of the materiall world, and the glory which they bring
<pb facs="tcp:101476:6"/> to God their Maker, doth in a myſticall ſenſe, foretell of the Apoſtles, and the glory which they ſhall bring to the Lord, who gave them to be Apoſtles, by their preaching. For in the <hi>new world</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> framed, that is, in the <hi>Church</hi> of Chriſt, the Apoſtles are the higheſt and chiefeſt Creatures (hence in the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of an houſe, they are likened to the foundations, which are the <hi>chiefeſt</hi> parts and moſt to be regarded in a building, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20.) And they are the lighteſt alſo; for our Saviour ſaith to them, <hi>Yee are the light of the world,</hi> Matth. 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14.</p>
            <p>But to return to that, from which we may ſeem to have digreſſed. That which our Prophet ſaith of himſelf in the firſt ſenſe, <hi>Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 12. <hi>I and the children, which thou haſt given me;</hi> is ſaid alſo by <hi>Chriſt</hi> of himſelf in the <hi>Second,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 13. But it is ſpoken by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> otherwiſe than it is by <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for it is ſpoken by <hi>Iſaiah properly,</hi> for he was the naturall father of theſe children which he ſpeakes of: But <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the Father of theſe Children, which he ſpeakes of onely by a <hi>Metaphor.</hi> So in theſe wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Or if <hi>Death</hi> be taken for that which deprives a man of life; the meaning of the words is this: That the Lord will deſtroy death that it ſhall kill no more. But as the words are taken in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe (as they are taken 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 55. Death is to be taken <hi>properly,</hi> for the deprivation of life: And the ſenſe of the words is; That the Lord will ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy death, and triumph over it, as that he will reſtore thoſe which are dead to life again. So <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 35. <hi>v.</hi> 4. In the words which we read there, <hi>to wit, Then ſhall the lame leap as an Hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing; The lame,</hi> and <hi>the dumb</hi> (as the words are taken in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Literall,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtoricall,</hi> and <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe) are taken <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> for thoſe that are in ſuch extremity of grief, as that they have no deſire either to talke or to walk, but ſit as <hi>dumb</hi> and <hi>lame</hi> men. But in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, they are taken <hi>properly,</hi> for him that is <hi>lame</hi> indeed; And him that is <hi>dumb</hi> indeed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt thing that I deſired to betaken notice of was this, That though in many Hiſtories <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>as I may call them) and Propheſies, of thoſe holy Writers, there be ſometimes one, ſometimes more ſentences, which ſignifie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by their words, not onely ſome paſſage, or paſſages, which appertain to the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> Senſe: But alſo ſome paſſage, or paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which appertain to the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> Senſe: Yet it is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, neither is it alwayes ſo, (yea, it is very ſeldome ſo) that every ſentence of the whole Propheſie, or Hiſtory (as I may call it) doth ſignifie immediately by its words, thoſe paſſage, or paſſages, which appertain to the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, as they doe thoſe paſſages which appertain to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtorical,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> Senſe. Which ſome not obſerving, where they have aſſuredly found a ſentence belonging to ſome paſſage of the Sublime ſenſe; thinking therefore, that the whole Context muſt neceſſarily thereunto apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain word by word, have attempted to conſtrue the Context word by word accordingly; and have rack'd the words, yet have they not made them ſpeak good ſenſe.</p>
            <p>But that it is not neceſſary, nor is it alwayes true, that where one ſentence is found, appertaining word by word to the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe; the ſentences adjoyning muſt therefore appertain to the ſame ſenſe word by word;
<pb facs="tcp:101476:7"/> is evident by theſe examples following, for <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 46. Thoſe words, <hi>Neither ſhall yee break a bone thereof,</hi> appertain in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi> ſenſe, to our Saviour <hi>Chriſt, John</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 36. But though that ſentence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth word by word to our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe; yet cannot the ſentences preceding, or following, be conſtrued of him word by word, as he which readeth them muſt needs confeſſe. So that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. <hi>I will be his Father, and he ſhall be my Sonne,</hi> is ſpoke of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5. Yet cannot the words following in that verſe be underſtood of him, <hi>to wit, If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit iniquity I will chaſten him with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men.</hi> So thoſe words, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>Except the Lord of Hoſts had left unto us a very ſmall remnant, we ſhould have been as</hi> Sodome, <hi>and we ſhould have been like unto</hi> Gomorrah, ſignifie in the and <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, that many ſhould periſh through unbelief, and that a <hi>Remnant onely ſhould be ſaved, according to the election of Grace, Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 29. But the preceding verſes of the Context cannot be underſtood and conſtrued word by word of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Now by what hath been ſpoken, it is eaſie to conjecture, which of the two (where there be theſe two ſenſes) is the <hi>Thorow-ſenſe, that is,</hi> which of the two ſenſes, the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner;</hi> or the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime</hi> ſenſe, is that, which is continued and carried word by word through an whole Hiſtory or Propheſie: (For I cannot perſwade my ſelf, that any holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is herein defective, and that he ſhould neither one way nor other goe through with his ſenſe.)</p>
            <p>Certainly it is the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe; and for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage through of this (as being that which muſt be firſt known, before we can rightly know the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe) I have bent my poor labours in this work.</p>
            <p>But (you will ſay) to take paines about the <hi>Firſt, Literall, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> ſenſe, is to favour <hi>Judaiſme;</hi> and to make the heart of the <hi>Jew</hi> (which is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate enough) yet more obſtinate towards the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> yea, it is to weaken the cauſe of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer, That to take paines for the finding out of the <hi>Literall</hi> ſenſe is no whit to favour <hi>Judaiſme,</hi> but to ſeek out the Truth; and if the ſeeking of the Truth, makes the <hi>Jew</hi> obſtinate towards the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or towards <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> it doth it but <hi>occaſionally,</hi> and the very beſt things may be an <hi>occaſion</hi> of the worſt of evils.</p>
            <p>Where the <hi>Jew</hi> hath good reaſon to ſtand for a <hi>Literall</hi> ſenſe, there to deny him a <hi>Literall</hi> ſenſe, may prove a ſtumbling block in his way: But if we grant him his <hi>Literall</hi> ſenſe, we take away the ſtumbling block; yet we give him no advantage againſt the <hi>Myſticall,</hi> which I may call the <hi>Goſpel</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian-ſenſe:</hi> For what if we grant him a <hi>Literall</hi> ſenſe, can he therefore juſtly deny a <hi>Myſticall?</hi> Doe not many places of the Law and the Prophets carry a double ſenſe with them? The <hi>Jew</hi> therefore cannot juſtly be hardened by this, neither can this weaken the cauſe of the Chriſtian, yea, by this the cauſe of the Chriſtian is rather ſtrengthened againſt the <hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Jew</hi> hath nothing juſtly to object againſt it.</p>
            <p>But though I have taken paines about the <hi>Firſt, Literally, Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe; I have not neglected the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> or <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe: But have, as neer as I could, cleared all the Texts of this our Prophet, which either
<pb facs="tcp:101476:7"/> our Saviour <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> made uſe of, in that ſenſe, in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And if any Text hath been omitted, it may eaſily be cleared by Obſervation of what I have ſaid before, and what I ſhall now ſay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Therefore the corporall and earthly Redemptions and deliverances of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the Propheſies thereof; were Types, and Figures, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies of the ſpirituall and heavenly Redemption which is wrought by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And by this Rule doe the Apoſtles, for the moſt part, walk, in applying of the Teſtimonies, which they bring out of the Old Teſtament, to the things of the New. And hence it is, (becauſe the Inhabitants of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> were delivered from the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> for <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s ſake: And becauſe the <hi>Jewes</hi> were delivered from the <hi>Babylonians</hi> by <hi>Cyrus:</hi> And becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> preached and propheſied of this deliverance;) that <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> were Types and Figures of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for whoſe ſake, and by whom, Man was redeemed, and who came and preached himſelf of this Redemption.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The temporall deſtruction of thoſe Cities, and thoſe Men (were they <hi>Jewes</hi> or others) which were Enemies, either to God, or to his People, and the Predictions thereof, were Types, and Figures of the eternall deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Unbelievers, and the Enemies of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and Predictions thereof.</p>
            <p>And from theſe conſiderations, <hi>to wit,</hi> that the corporall and earthly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptions and deliverances of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> were Types and Figures of the ſpirituall and heavenly Redemption which is wrought by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> And that the temporall deſtruction of thoſe Cities, and thoſe Men, which were Enemies to God and to his People, were Types and Figures of the eternall deſtruction of Unbelievers, and the enemies of the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> From theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (I ſay) it ſeemeth to be, that our Prophet, propheſying of the temporall ſalvation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and the temporall deſtruction of their Enemies, and the Enemies of God, doth often ſpeak of them in ſuch high and hyperbolicall termes, as though he would not have us to look onely on the immediate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which he ſpeaks of, which fall farre ſhort of thoſe expreſſions, which he uſeth of them in their proper and naturall ſignification, but to ſome higher ſubjects alſo, which the words taken in their height would better fit, at leaſt in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> were rejected of God from being his People; <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6, 9. And God did afterwards receive this people again, which he had rejected (though not to be a People of themſelves, yet to live in his favour (as many of them as believed the Prophets) with the <hi>Jewes) Hoſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 10. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was the reception again of the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> whom the Lord had rejected, a Type of the calling and accepting of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> whom he had neglected and rejected before.</p>
            <p>And hence it is, that that which <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeakes of the reception again of the <hi>ten Tribes, Hoſ.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 10. in theſe words [<hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe, that in the place where it was ſaid unto them, ye are the ſonnes of the living God:</hi> And again, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 23. <hi>I will ſay to them which were not my People, thou art my People; And they ſhall ſay, Thou art my God.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> applieth to the calling and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gentiles, as meant of them, in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 25, 26. Where note, that if any ſentence be ſpoken of any paſſage of any thing to come to paſſe before the dayes of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> in the <hi>Firſt, Literal,
<pb facs="tcp:101476:8"/> Hiſtoricall,</hi> or <hi>Meaner</hi> ſenſe: And of a paſſage to come to paſſe in the dayes of the <hi>Meſsiah,</hi> in the <hi>Second, Myſticall,</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, the immediate Subject of the whole Hiſtory, or whole Propheſie, of which that ſentence is a part, is to be deemed (if I be not deceived) as a Type and Figure of the whole thing which was to come to paſſe in the dayes of the <hi>Meſsiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thoſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> which would not give credit to <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets which the Lord ſent to them, during the time of the Law, were a Type and Figure of thoſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> which would not believe the Goſpell of Chriſt in the dayes of the Goſpel: Hence it is, that that which was ſaid of the one, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 9, 10. is ſpoken alſo of the other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Thoſe Heathen which joyned themſelves to the Lord, and became <hi>Proſelytes</hi> under the Law: were a Type of the coming in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the Church, and their joyning themſelves to <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixtly,</hi> Thoſe Heathen which believed the Servants of the Lord, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies which they delivered (which the <hi>Jewes</hi> would not believe) were a Type and Figure, and did fore-ſignifie, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would receive the Goſpel of Chriſt, when the <hi>Jewes</hi> refuſed it.</p>
            <p>Hence that which is ſpoken of the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and others, <hi>Iſaiah Cap.</hi> 52. <hi>v.</hi> 15. in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> is applied to the believing <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the Goſpel in the <hi>Second</hi> ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 21. And that which is ſpoken by way of Propheſie of one, may be underſtood of the other alſo.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Heathen, doing what the Lord would have them to doe, in the time of the Old Teſtament, were uſed oftentimes as Types of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would yeild to the Goſpel of Chriſt in the dayes of the New. Compare <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65.1. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.20.</p>
            <p>Thus was the Lord pleaſed, under the Law (yea, and before the Law too) to ſhaddow out to us, and as it were rudely to draw the things concerning <hi>Chriſt Jeſus, who was fore-known, or fore-ordained, before the foundation of the world; but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.20.</p>
            <p>Now in this Expoſition of ours, I have followed our common, <hi>that is to ſay,</hi> the new Tranſlation, than which generally none is better: But note, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in many places of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, the ſame words carry a double ſenſe, an <hi>Hiſtoricall</hi> and a <hi>Myſticall,</hi> or a <hi>Meaner</hi> and a <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe; and one language cannot ſo happily expreſſe a double ſenſe as the other may: Our Engliſh Tranſlation is more for the <hi>Myſticall</hi> and <hi>Sublime</hi> ſenſe, than for the <hi>Meaner</hi> and <hi>Hiſtoricall;</hi> which may perhaps make ſome wonder at the interpretation of ſome places, which I have given in purſuance of the <hi>Meaner</hi> and <hi>Hiſtoricall</hi> ſenſe, untill they look back to the Originall, which when they have looked back to, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, they will ceaſe to wonder.</p>
            <p>And though I follow our Engliſh Tranſlation, yet have I interpreted many <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Prepoſitions,</hi> otherwiſe than they are commonly uſed with us in our Native Language; As <hi>And for, for moreover, In for,</hi> or <hi>becauſe of, &amp;c.</hi> But beſides that, that the reaſon of every reſpective place requireth it, know, that theſe <hi>Conjunctions</hi> and <hi>Prepoſitions</hi> are there become, not ſo much <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew:</hi> For our Tranſlators, rendring the <hi>Hebrew</hi> by what it moſt commonly ſignifieth, leave the Engliſh word, as an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> to ſignifie not onely what it commonly ſignifieth with us, but to ſignifie alſo as many things as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifieth.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:101476:8"/>
            <p>As for example; Becauſe the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Praefix VAU, ſignifieth commonly <hi>And,</hi> our Tranſlators render it <hi>And:</hi> But becauſe VAU ſignifieth not onely <hi>And,</hi> but ſometimes <hi>For,</hi> they leave <hi>And</hi> to ſignifie <hi>For</hi> too: Yea, they leave it of as a great latitude as VAU is, and to ſignifie as many things as VAU doth.</p>
            <p>And our Tranſlators in this are not ſingular, for the <hi>Pen-men</hi> of the New Teſtament doe the like; for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> if at leaſt St. <hi>Matthew</hi> wrote in <hi>Greek</hi>) uſeth <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>How is the faithfull City become an Harlot.]</hi> How is <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> which was once faithfull, as a wife to her husband, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come now as an harlot, committing adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with her lovers?</p>
                  <p>The faithfullneſſe here ſpoken of, alludes to the faithfulneſſe of a wife to her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures, under the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of Adultery and Fornication, do often ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie peculiarly the ſin of <hi>Idolatry:</hi> And under the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of an <hi>Whore</hi> or an <hi>Harlot,</hi> an <hi>Idolater.</hi> And ſo it may be here taken, eſpecially if we underſtand <hi>Alſo,</hi> In the following words, <hi>q. d. How is the faithfull City become an Harlot? It was</hi> Alſo <hi>full of Judgement,</hi> &amp;c. For the Prophet upbraids them with their Idolatry <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as by the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of <hi>Fornication</hi> and <hi>Adultery,</hi> the particular ſinne of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> is often underſtood: So alſo may we (by the ſame <hi>Metaphor</hi>) underſtand <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> and <hi>ſinne</hi> againſt God in generall, as may appear <hi>James,</hi> 4.4. For the promiſe of obedience, which the <hi>Jewes</hi> made to God, either in their Forefathers, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.27. Or by themſelves, either in their Circumciſion, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.3. or at any other time, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12, 15. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.16. may be compared to the promiſe of a wife, which ſhe makes to to her husband at her marriage, to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient to him, and true to his bed.</p>
                  <p>And for this reaſon doth the Lord ſay to <hi>Sion,</hi> that He is her husband, <hi>Chap.</hi> 54. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore as a Wife, ſo long as ſhe keepeth the promiſe which ſhe made to her Husband, is accounted <hi>Faithfull,</hi> but if ſhe breaketh that promiſe, and falls in love with other men, and followeth them, becommeth a <hi>Whore,</hi> or an <hi>Harlot;</hi> So might <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> be accounted <hi>Faithfull,</hi> ſo long as ſhe was obedient to God, according to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But when contrary to promiſe ſhe became diſobedient to God, and followed her own luſts, ſhe might be counted of as an <hi>Harlot,</hi> and ſo be called by a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus not onely <hi>Idolatry,</hi> but any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>particular ſinne,</hi> may be called <hi>Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and not onely the <hi>Idolater,</hi> but any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſinner</hi> be called an <hi>Adulterer:</hi> And he which walketh uprightly according to his Covenant, that is, according to the Law of God, which he promiſed to keep, might be called <hi>Faithfull:</hi> and among the reſt, He who executed judgement without reſpect of perſons: For which cauſe <hi>Sion</hi> alſo may be called <hi>Faithfull</hi> in this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How is the faithfull City,</hi> &amp;c.] This queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſpeakes admiration and ſorrow.</p>

So that the meaning of this place is, that many of many Nations and People ſhall come with <hi>chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe,</hi> and in <hi>great abundance</hi> to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God in <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> to worſhip the Lord there, and it containeth a reaſon why the Temple of God ſhould ſurpaſſe all other Temples, and be above them all, in honour and eſteem, and the reaſon is, becauſe all Nations ſhall forſake the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Idols, and ſhall come willingly, and in abundance to the Temple of the Lord, to worſhip the Lord there.</p>
                  <p>This Propheſie (in its firſt and meaner ſenſe) ſeemeth to have been fulfilled in the dayes of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when the Angel of God had deſtroyed an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand in one night, in the Campe of the <hi>Aſſyrians:</hi> And when God (that he might give to <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a ſigne of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, when he was ſick) brought the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of the Sun ten degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the Diall of <hi>Ahaz.</hi>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:101476:21"/>
                  <p>For when theſe great miracles were heard of, no doubt but many did enquire after the truth of them, and finding the Truth to be according to the Report, did conclude with themſelves, that the Gods, which they worſhipt, were not like to the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who had done theſe great Things, yea, they were no Gods in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Him; therefore they would worſhip Him, and He ſhould be their God.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed by that, that theſe miracles were ſo taken notice of, as that the Princes of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> to enquire of the wonder (of the Suns going back) that was done in the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.31. And upon the cutting off of ſo many of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in <hi>Sennacharibs</hi> Camp by the Angel, it is ſaid, <hi>that many brought gifts to the Lord to</hi> Hieruſalem, <hi>ſo that he was magnified in the ſight of all Nations from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32.23.</p>
                  <p>But yet (as I ſaid) in a ſecond and more ſublime Senſe, the Prophet without doubt doth here propheſie of the Glory of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the time of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and the calling or coming in of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to that Church.</p>

                  <p>Note here, that when God doth exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute judgement upon the wicked, though he doth it not immediately by himſelf, but mediately by his inſtruments (as here he he doth it by the <hi>Babylonians</hi>) yet the Scripture doth oftentimes ſo deſcribe it, as if God were immediately in the action himſelfe, as chief, in a viſible manner, like a man, yea, ſometimes as though the whole buſineſſe were performed by him alone, and this it doth that the praiſe may be given to God alone, and not to his inſtruments. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.1. And when the Scripture doth ſpeak this of God and imply him in ſuch an action, it deſcribes him after a glorious manner, that he may appear to be more than man: And in their deſcriptions, the Scripture alludeth, for the moſt part, to thoſe apparitions, by which God did manifeſt himſelf, and to thoſe wonderous works which he wrought, and thoſe accidents which fell out, and thoſe judgements which he executed upon the enemies of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their conduct from <hi>Aegypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan:</hi> A ſhort model where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you may read <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Hence it is, that it is ſaid, <hi>Let the Earth be glad,</hi> Pſal. 96. verſ. 11. And <hi>let the Earth rejoyce,</hi> 1 Chron 16 v. 31.

                  <p>For note, that they were wont not one- to <hi>grind</hi> their wheat in a <hi>Mill,</hi> but alſo to <hi>bray</hi> it, and <hi>beat</hi> it in pieces in a <hi>morter</hi> (as appeareth <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22.) that they may get the flower out of it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sins reſidence</hi> is onely in the <hi>ſoul,</hi> and the <hi>members of the body</hi> are called, <hi>ſinnefull</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>ſinne</hi> there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſinne of the lips</hi> which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of, is thought to have been, not ſo much in <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> what he ſhould not, as in not <hi>ſpeaking</hi> what he ſhould, <hi>that is,</hi> in not reprehending the ſins of the <hi>Princes,</hi> and of the <hi>People,</hi> ſo freely, as he ſhould have done.</p>
                  <p>By this <hi>Sinne of his lips,</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, all other <hi>Sins</hi> of his, by a <hi>Synecdoche, q. d.</hi> I am <hi>uncleane</hi> every part of me, not ſomuch as my <hi>lippes,</hi> but are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſon why he mentioneth the <hi>uncleaneſſe,</hi> or <hi>ſinne of his lipps,</hi> rather than any other <hi>ſinne,</hi> may be, becauſe he could <hi>not occupie his lipps</hi> in the praiſes of God, as the <hi>Seraphims</hi> did. For <hi>Praiſe is not ſeemly in the mouth of a Sinnner.</hi> Eccleſ. 15. <hi>v.</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>And the Prophet was the more afflicted for his ſinne, becauſe he was in the ſight of Angels, whoſe <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> called his <hi>impurity</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſſe</hi> to minde, and made it appear the worſe: And becauſe he was in the <hi>ſight of God then, when</hi> He was ſeated upon his Throne <hi>to judge ſinners.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And I dwell in the midſt of the People of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane lipps.]</hi> The men of <hi>Judah</hi> were men of <hi>uncleane lipps:</hi> For <hi>their tongue provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God to anger.</hi> Cap. 3. v. 8. And <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared their ſinns as</hi> Sodom, <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 9. And when they heard of Gods judgements, they ſaid preſumptuouſly, <hi>Let God make ſpeed, and haſten his work, that we may ſee it.</hi> Cap. 5 v. 19. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by the <hi>uncleaneſſe</hi> of <hi>their lipps,</hi> we muſt underſtand here alſo, all <hi>other their ſin and uncleaneſſe,</hi> by a <hi>Synecdoche.</hi> But the Prophet mentioneth no more than the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleaneſſe of their lipps,</hi> becauſe he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more of his own <hi>uncleaneſſe,</hi> than that of his <hi>lipps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth the Prophet mention the <hi>uncleaneſſe of the Peoples lips,</hi> that is, their <hi>ſinne,</hi> in this place?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Not to <hi>excuſe himſelf</hi> and lay the fault upon <hi>them,</hi> as though he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken his ſin from them by a Contagion or living among them; but rather to <hi>aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment his own ſinne,</hi> and lay their ſinne upon himſelf, as though they came to be ſo bad, becauſe he neglected to reprove them: Or at leaſt, <hi>to augment his miſerable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in that he could have no hope of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judgement of God, or having it deferred, being they were uncleane among whom he lived, aſwell as himſelf. For whereas God hath been known, to ſpare ſome wicked men for the righteous ſake, among whom they lived, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> could have no hope of this now, becauſe the People among whom he lived, were polluted, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well as himſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For mine eyes have ſeen the King the Lord of Hoſts.] q. d.</hi> I ſay woe is me, For <hi>mine eyes</hi> (who am a man of unclean lips) <hi>have ſeen the King, the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>There was an opinion among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that whoſoever <hi>ſaw</hi> God ſhould ſurely <hi>die, Judg.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 22. Which opinion ſprung from thoſe words of God to <hi>Moſes, There ſhall no man ſee me and live,</hi> Exod. 33. v. 20.</p>
                  <p>But if the meer ſeeing of God might make the Prophet cry, <hi>Woe to me, I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> then might he much more cry ſo, when he <hi>ſaw God ſitting on his Throne to judge ſinners,</hi> he being conſcious to himſelf of his ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſe therefore of this place is this, <hi>q. d.

                  <p>The <hi>judgements</hi> of God, that is, the afflictions and calamities, which befall men for their ſinnes, are often compared to <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> and <hi>wounds,</hi> and <hi>ſores.</hi> As <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>c.</hi> 30. <hi>v.</hi> 26.

                  </p>
                  <p>Or, <hi>And be healed,</hi> may ſignifie, and <hi>have their ſinnes forgiven.</hi> For <hi>ſinne</hi> is the <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Sickneſſe</hi> of the Soul, of which Plague and <hi>Sickneſſe</hi> we are <hi>healed,</hi> when our ſin is forgiven.</p>
                  <p>But a man may object here and ſay. Is it likely that any one would <hi>affect</hi> ſpirituall <hi>blindneſſe</hi> and <hi>unbeliefe</hi> for this end, that he might <hi>not be healed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not likely that a man would <hi>affect</hi> ſpirituall blindneſſe and unbelief, <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>chiefly</hi> for this end that <hi>he might not be healed:</hi> But it is more than likely, that many make it their <hi>indirect end,</hi> and <hi>end by conſequence:</hi> For many make that their ends, upon which this muſt needs follow: For many do <hi>directly</hi> deſire to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin without controll, and for this end do hate them, which tell them of the word of the Lord, or denounce his judgements againſt them, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they muſt hear and believe to, before they can repent, and be ſaved; So they deſire not to be healed, by <hi>conſequence</hi> and in the <hi>cauſes</hi> thereof; though they do it not, <hi>directly,</hi> and in <hi>it ſelf.</hi>
                  </p>

Hence it was that <hi>Adoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> when he feared King <hi>Salomon,</hi> caught hold of the hornes of the Altar (which was before the Tabernacle, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 29.

                  <p>But as for the Originall of this practice, I do not remember that it is any where written, that God appointed the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to be a place of refuge for any ſort of men, as he did appoint certaine Cities, to <hi>be Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of refuge for the man-ſlayer,</hi> Deut. 19. <hi>v.</hi> 2. and <hi>Joſh.</hi> 20.2.

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> He reſembled theſe to the <hi>tail,</hi> becauſe (it is moſt probable) that they were not onely <hi>of the loweſt</hi> and <hi>meaneſt rank</hi> in the whole Common-wealth of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but the <hi>loweſt and meaneſt of all the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, theſe <hi>falſe Prophets</hi> were not onely the <hi>loweſt</hi> and <hi>meaneſt</hi> of thoſe which were the loweſt and meaneſt, by their <hi>birth</hi> and <hi>condition;</hi> but the baſeſt of all the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their manners, and cuſtome of life alſo: For they lived altogether by <hi>flattery,</hi> and whereas a <hi>flatterer</hi> is the baſeſt fellow that liveth, they were the baſeſt of all <hi>flatterers;</hi> and for this reaſon alſo might he compare theſe men to the <hi>tail;</hi> though he doth it principally, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for the firſt reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Again, many think that the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled theſe Prophets to the <hi>tail,</hi> becauſe they did flatter, and fawn upon the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (the wealthieſt eſpecially) and did put a fair gloſſe upon their foul ſtinking ſin.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet nameth theſe 2 tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> the more to exaggerate and ſet out the greatneſs of this Calamity: For <hi>Ephraim</hi> &amp; <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> were not onely the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but alſo the Children of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and therefore neerer allied between themſelves than any other Tribes were; It is therefore the ſign of the greater miſerie; that <hi>they</hi> ſhould deſtroy one another.</p>
                  <p>At what time this that the Prophet here propheſieth of, came to paſſe, cannot be certainely gathered from the Scripture: But this by conjecture; Though <hi>Salmane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> lead the greateſt part of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> away Captive, and broke the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from being any more a Kingdome; yet after <hi>Salmaneſer</hi>'s depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſome of every Tribe were left in the Land of <hi>Iſrael, Cap.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which had fled away and hid themſelves for fear of <hi>Salmaneſer,</hi> returned and dwelt in the Land of <hi>Iſrael</hi> againe. And between that time and <hi>Sennacherib</hi>'s expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Judah,</hi> they had ſtrengthened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and they with others had fortified <hi>Samaria</hi> for themſelves, So that <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> had ſome work there, before he marched againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> as may be gathered with probability out of 2 <hi>Kings, Cap.</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>In that work therefore which <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib</hi> had to reduce <hi>Samaria,</hi> and thoſe that rebelled, it is likely that he preſſed many of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſerve him againſt <hi>Samaria:</hi> So that now a Child of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fought againſt a Child of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther killed and deſtroyed a brother, an <hi>Ephramite</hi> a <hi>Manaſſite,</hi> and a <hi>Manaſſite</hi> an <hi>Ephramite:</hi> And when he went againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> It is likely that he carried many of the Children of <hi>Iſrael to ſerve him,</hi> and to fight for him, in that expedition againſt <hi>Judah:</hi> And thus it might come to paſſe which he here ſaith, <hi>No man ſhall ſpare his Brother, they ſhall eat every man the fleſh of his own arme,</hi> Manaſſeh Ephraim, <hi>and</hi> Eph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raim Manaſſeh; <hi>and they together ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt</hi> Judah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they together ſhall be againſt</hi> Judah.] This, as I ſaid, is likely to have been when <hi>Sennacherib</hi> went in his expedition againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> and beſiedged <hi>Hieruſalem:</hi> For <hi>Conquerours</hi> uſe to make uſe of the <hi>Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> to fight their battels, and ſo might he make uſe of many of the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> to fight againſt the Tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> even againſt their wills.</p>
                  <p>Note, that though the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were enemies to the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> and did often conſpire with other nations againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> while they were a <hi>Kingdome and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of themſelves;</hi> Yet after their <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:101476:57"/> was deſtroyed by <hi>Salmaneſer,</hi> and they were no longer a <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> they which remained and dwelt afterwards in the Land, did ſtick cloſe to the men of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dath,</hi> and were in good Amity and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with <hi>them;</hi> And the men of <hi>Judah</hi> with <hi>them</hi> againe, as affording them ſuch ſuccour and refuge, as one wanted, and the other could give, as may be gathered from <hi>Cap.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. A great part therefore muſt it be of the Miſery of the ten <hi>Tribes;</hi> that they ſhould be forced to fight againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> at ſuch a time as <hi>Judah</hi> and they, were ſuch friends, and they received all kindneſſe at <hi>Judah</hi>'s hands.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>After all the miſery which is here ſpoken of, the Children of the ten <hi>Tribes</hi> did ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer much hardſhip and bitterneſſe in the Land of their Captivity, and elſewhere.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>This Chapter therefore depends upon the former, and containes a reaſon why the Lord would deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as is mentioned in the later part of the former Chapter: The reaſon whereof is, becauſe <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> was to be King at that time,, who would prove a godly and religious King, and therefore God would ſo favour him, as that for his ſake, he would deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reaſon alſo the Prophet gives of the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> Army, when he mentioneth it, <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.6. and <hi>Cap.</hi> 10.27.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Particle, <hi>And,</hi> may be here rendered <hi>For,</hi> q. d. <hi>For</hi> there ſhall come forth a rod out of the ſtemme of <hi>Jeſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But here ſome do object, That <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> cannot be here meant by this Rod, which ſhould come out of the ſtemme of <hi>Jeſſe:</hi> For it is not here ſaid that this Rod <hi>is come forth,</hi> but that it <hi>ſhall come forth,</hi> out of the ſtemme of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> But <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was come out of the ſtemme of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> already, and was <hi>ſprung up,</hi> and was of good years at the time of this Propheſie, for before this time the Prophet was ſent to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who was then King of <hi>Judah, Cap.</hi> 7. And that was before this in order of time, for it is ſet down in the book before it: And if the Prophet propheſied to <hi>Ahaz</hi> when he was King, before he declared this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, then muſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> be at that time at leaſt nine yeares old, for <hi>Ahaz</hi> raigned but ſixteen yeares, 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 16.2. and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Ahaz</hi> his Father immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and when <hi>Hezekiah</hi> began to raign, he was twenty five yeares old 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. <hi>v.</hi> 2. By this Rod therefore we cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Hezekiah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this I ſay, Firſt, that though the Propheſie, which the Prophet propheſied to <hi>Ahaz,</hi> be ſet down, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred in order before this Propheſie, as that being regiſtred in the ſeventh, this in the eleventh Chapter, yet it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low for that reaſon, that that Propheſie was before this in order of time: For it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by all Interpreters, that the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> are not regiſtred in this book, in the ſame order of time, as they were at the firſt delivered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I may anſwer, that becauſe neither the particular time of the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Aſſyrian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, The Prophet ſpeakes here of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> not as of a private perſon, but as of a King: And therefore though he was born before this, yet becauſe he was not a King before this, he might ſay, there ſhall come forth a Rod out of the ſtemme of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Howſoever we read <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.29. <hi>Rejoyce not thou whole</hi> Paleſtina, <hi>becauſe the Rod of him that ſmote thee is broken: For out of the Serpents Root ſhall come forth a Cockatrice. And his fruit ſhall be a fiery flying Serpent:</hi> Where, that by the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> and <hi>fiery fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serpent</hi> is meant <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> is generally agreed by all: And it was ſpoken in the year that <hi>Ahaz</hi> died, <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 28. at

                  <p>If therefore any one be not ſatisfied with the former Anſwers, let him tell how the Prophet could ſay, <hi>Out of the Serpents root ſhall come a fiery flying Serpent,</hi> &amp;c. when as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was born already, and what he ſaies in ſatisfaction to that place, will likewiſe ſatisfie this.</p>

                  <p>The meaning of theſe words are, <hi>That the Lord ſhall bring his People which fled into</hi> Aegypt, <hi>to ſave themſelves, when</hi> Tiglah-Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſer, <hi>and</hi> Salmaneſer, <hi>and</hi> Sennacherib, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded their Land with their Armies, ſafe out of</hi> Aegypt <hi>againe, into the land of</hi> Judah.

                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That <hi>Babylon,</hi> when the <hi>Medes</hi> invaded the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, was grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly ruined, is more than probable: For at that time <hi>Babylon</hi> was not not ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified, as it had been in former, and was in after times. For <hi>Euſebius</hi> report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth (in the end of the ninth book of his <hi>Evangelicall preparation</hi>) out of <hi>Abyde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> that <hi>Belus</hi> had fortified <hi>Babylon</hi> with a wall; but that that wall was in proceſſe of time aboliſhed, untill <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> fortified it again with a new wall. So that it was no hard matter for the <hi>Medes</hi> to take <hi>Babylon</hi> by force and ſtorm in that <hi>interim:</hi> And by force and ſtorm it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they took it; and having ſo taken it, that they did fire it, and grievouſly rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it: For as though it had been utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruinated at that time, <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> ſaith of what he built afterwards, is <hi>not this great</hi> Babylon <hi>which I have built? Dan.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p>So then when the <hi>Medes</hi> did deſtroy the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire, <hi>Babylon</hi> (in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) was grievouſly ruined (beſides that, that the power of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which ruled there, was quite deſtroyed) yet ſome part of it (without doubt) was left re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, as may be gathered from 2 <hi>Kings. chap.</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 12. where mention is made of <hi>Baladon</hi> King of <hi>Babylon</hi> (though we know, that men oftentimes bear titles from places which have been, but now are not) therefore it is ſaid here, that <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> ſhall be as when God overthrew <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> I conceive, that <hi>Babylon</hi> is to be taken, <hi>per Synechdochen integri,</hi> for the <hi>greateſt part of Babylon:</hi> And in all likelihood, the <hi>greateſt part of Babylon</hi> was utterly deſtroyed at this time. I conceive moreover, that though <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> did build <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet that part of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was ſo ruinated by the <hi>Medes,</hi> was never built or inhabited again; and that <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> built not upon the old ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines, but upon new ground, as <hi>Rome,</hi> which was built after the inundation of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> was not built upon the old ruines, but lower, on the bank of <hi>Tiber</hi> upon <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Martius,</hi> and hath little left of old <hi>Rome,</hi> but onely the name, as being not ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Neither ſhall the</hi> Arabian <hi>pitch Tent there.]</hi> There were <hi>Arabians,</hi> which lived wholly upon their cattle, which they drove from place to place for freſh paſture: And they themſelves lived in Tents, which they moved from place to place for the more benefit of their flocks and herds; from their living in Tents they were called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabes Scenitae,</hi> and from their feeding of cattle, <hi>Nomades.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe <hi>Arabians</hi> bordered upon <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> and therefore it had been convenient for them to have pitch'd their Tents, and fed their cattle there, if there had been good conveniency there for feeding of cattle: But he ſaith, <hi>the</hi> Arabian <hi>ſhall not pitch his Tent there,</hi> to wit, <hi>there to feed his cattle,</hi> becauſe it ſhould not be a place <hi>fit to feed cattle,</hi> by reaſon of the ruines and rubbiſh which ſhould be there; and the briars and thornes which ſhould grow up there; and eſpecially becauſe of the wild beaſt (which he mentioneth in the next verſe) which ſhould lodge there.</p>
                  <p>Yet note, that by an <hi>Arabian</hi> we may underſtand, <hi>Metonymically,</hi> any one which led that kind of life, as thoſe <hi>Arabians</hi> did, though he were not an <hi>Arabian</hi> born: <hi>that is,</hi> any <hi>Shepheard,</hi> and ſo by an <hi>Arabian</hi> may be meant, a <hi>Shepheard</hi> here, as well as a <hi>naturall Arabian.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If it be asked, why he is called here ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> than <hi>King of Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reaſons may be; Firſt, becauſe the Prophet did propheſie of the great overthrow of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which, as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, felt more of the <hi>Medes</hi> fury than any place of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire beſides: That therefore he might more lively ſet out the calamity which ſhould befall the <hi>King of Aſſyria,</hi> he calls him the <hi>King of Babylon,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, The <hi>King of that Babylon,</hi> whoſe overthrow ſhould be as the overthrow of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He might be called the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> here, becauſe that it is likely, that more of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were captive in <hi>Babylon,</hi> than in any other place of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Empire beſides, and more hardly and cruelly uſed there: And there dwelt the <hi>Exactors</hi> of that Tribute, which had been laid upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and there was that Tribute paid in: That therefore the deſtruction of the <hi>King of Aſſyria</hi> might more affectionately work upon the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and make them more joyful, having ſuffered ſo many things from <hi>Babylon,</hi> he calls the <hi>King of Aſſyria, King of Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this King of <hi>Babylon</hi> is meant in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>Sennacherib</hi> (as will appear by the proceſſe of this proverbe or ſong.)</p>
                  <p>And this may be the reaſon why <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib</hi> is made the ſubject of this Song or Proverb more than any other King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; to wit,</hi> becauſe no King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Aſſyria</hi> did ever oppreſſe the <hi>Jewes</hi> (whom this book moſt concerns, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.1.) more than <hi>Sennacherib</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was in a manner the laſt King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> at leaſt the <hi>laſt Oppreſſour</hi> of that Race. For though after he was ſlaine, <hi>Eſar-haddon</hi> his Sonne reigned in his ſtead, <hi>Cap.</hi> 37.38. yet his Raign was but exceeding ſhort, for he was ſcarce ſeated in the Throne, when the <hi>Medes</hi> came and deſtroyed his Empire: And the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were with <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſcarce, heard of his being King, much leſſe did feel the hand of his Oppreſſion: and yet there is ſomething in this Proverb which concerns <hi>Eſar-had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haddon</hi> and other the Children of <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rib, v.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How hath the Oppreſſour ceaſed?] q. d.</hi> How is it come to paſſe, that the <hi>King of Babylon</hi> (who was wont to Oppreſſe all kind of people, and make warre againſt them, onely that he might place his own Subjects in their Land, or make them his Tributaries) I ſay, how is it come to paſſe that this man ceaſeth ſo ſuddainly from his Oppreſſion, whereas he had ſo mighty a power to Oppreſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The golden City ceaſed?] q. d</hi> How hath the City, which was enriched with gold, which was extorted from all nations by way of tribute and exactions, ceaſed ſo ſuddainly to exact her Tribute?</p>
                  <p>Or thus, <hi>How hath the Oppreſſour ceaſed? The golden City ceaſed? i. e.</hi> How is the Oppreſſour periſhed? How hath the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en City been deſtroyed? For thoſe things which <hi>periſhed</hi> and are <hi>deſtroyed,</hi> are ſaid to <hi>ceaſe, (Supple,</hi> from <hi>being</hi>) whether they be men, or inanimate Creatures?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The golden City.]</hi> By the <hi>golden City,</hi> he meaneth <hi>Babylon,</hi> which he calleth the <hi>golden City</hi> by a <hi>Mimeſis,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylonians,</hi> in their pride were wont ſo to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:101476:72"/> call it; becauſe of the abundance of <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>riches</hi> which were therein, as being the City in which the <hi>Nobles</hi> and moſt <hi>wealthy men</hi> dwelt.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe he calls it the <hi>golden City,</hi> becauſe that thither the Tributes were carryed, and there payd, which the King of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted of the Nations round about, and ſo it abounded with gold and ſilver.</p>
                  <p>Some perhaps may here aske, how it was againſt <hi>Sennacherib</hi> to tell of the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when as <hi>Sennacherib</hi> was dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Babylon</hi> was overthrown?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer,</hi> The Prophet uſeth a kind of <hi>Poeſie</hi> in all this Proverbe, which he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and in <hi>Poeſie</hi> the <hi>dead</hi> are brought in, with like affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as if they were <hi>living.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe as in the Parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> our Saviour brings in <hi>Dives</hi> (when he was in Hell) taking care for his brethren and their well doing which were upon the earth, <hi>Luke,</hi> 16.28. So might the Prophet bring in <hi>Sennacherib</hi> (when he was dead) taking care for the wellfare of his Children, and as touched with their loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and with their death, and ſpoke of him as if it were grievous to him, whatſoever was grievous to them.</p>
                  <p>This Queſtion, is the Queſtion of one <hi>admiring</hi> and <hi>inſulting; Admiring</hi> at what was done, and <hi>inſulting</hi> over thoſe to whom it was done.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sackcloth</hi> doth often ſignifie in Scripture a mourning Garment, and ſo ſome take it; to ſignifie in this place, ſaying, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> mourned at this time, becauſe of the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Captivitie of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> which were carried away by <hi>Salmane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer;</hi> but others thinke that it ſignifies ſuch a garment as the Prophets did uſually wear. For Prophets were wont to weare <hi>Sackcloth</hi> which was made of haire, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.4. Such a one did <hi>Elias</hi> weare, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.8. And ſuch a one did <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> weare <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Naked,]</hi> It is not to be thought that the Prophet walked about <hi>ſtarke naked,</hi> but onely that he walked without his <hi>Sackcloth,</hi> though he wore a lower Garment, or a Shirt. The Prophet therefore was naked only <hi>ſecundum quid;</hi> and when he ſaith that he was naked, he uſeth a <hi>Synecdoche Integri,</hi> putting naked (which properly ſignifieth to be deſtitute of all Clothes) for, being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome certaine Clothes, this ſame word is uſed after the ſame manner, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.24.</p>
                  <p>By this, <hi>His walking naked and bare-foot,</hi> the Prophet might well ſignifie the Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and <hi>Ethiopians;</hi> for Captives uſed to be ſtript of their uppermoſt Garments by the Conquerors, and left in their poor under Clothes; yea, and they were often taken away too, and worſe were given they to weare.</p>

                     <hi>A grievous viſion is declared unto me,] i. e.</hi> Grievous things are declared to me in a viſion concerning <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He puts a <hi>viſion</hi> here <hi>per Metonymiam Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> for the things declared by a viſion: And note, that he makes the object of theſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, not onely things ſeen, but alſo things heard.</p>
                  <p>It may be here asked, of what and of whom this <hi>viſion</hi> is meant: But the anſwer to this is plain, it was of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and her calamitie and fall, as appears <hi>verſe</hi> 9.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond queſtion will be, Whether this <hi>viſion</hi> of the fall and calamitie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is to be taken as a new <hi>burthen</hi> diſtinct from the <hi>burthen</hi> of the <hi>Deſert of the ſea</hi> mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt verſe, or as a <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> If any one vvill take it for a nevv <hi>burthen,</hi> I quarrel him not; but yet I take it as a part of the former <hi>burthen, to wit,</hi> as part of the <hi>burthen of the Deſert of the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third queſtion therefore vvill be, How the <hi>burthen</hi> or fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the <hi>burthen</hi> of thoſe which lived in <hi>the Deſert of the ſea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It will concern them, as the <hi>burthen</hi> of <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> concerned the <hi>burthen</hi> or calamitie of the <hi>ten Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, Cap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. For as it was a great part of the calamitie of the ten Tribes, that <hi>Rezin</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> which were their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101476:95"/> ſhould be engaged in a Warre; yea, overcome when they had need of their help. So it was to <hi>Edom,</hi> that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould be overcome, from whom they expected aide againſt all that did oppoſe them, or make War upon them when they had need of her help.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is very likely that many of the <hi>Deſert of the ſea</hi> did ſerve the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> in their martiall affairs, and therefore the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt needs be their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie.</p>
                  <p>Again, the fall of <hi>Babylon</hi> was a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of the calamitie of the <hi>Edomites; for in that day that Babylon ſhould be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Medes, the Lord would beat off from the channel of the River, unto the ſtreame of Egypt,</hi> ſaith our Prophet, <hi>Cap.</hi> 27.12. That is, he would make all Lands deſolate which were in league with the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> from <hi>Euphrates</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> to <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the connexion therefore of theſe words with the former, it may be this, <hi>q.d.</hi> Neither can <hi>Babylon</hi> or the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> your confederates help you, for a grievous viſion is declared unto me, &amp;c.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>treacherous dealer</hi> he meaneth the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> which was treacherous in all his dealings, making leagues and covenants and contracts with other Nations, but keeping none of them longer then he could get ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by them, and breaking them when it was advantagious for him. Thus dealt he with other Nations, thus dealt he with the <hi>Jewes, Cap.</hi> 33.8. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16, 17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where he took a great price to leave his hoſtility and to return out of <hi>Judah,</hi> and yet he returned not, but waſted it, and beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

                  <p>Note, that by <hi>the daughter of my people</hi> may be meant <hi>Samaria</hi> onely, which was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101476:99"/> the chief City of the ten Tribes; for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> uſe to call a <hi>City</hi> by the name of a <hi>daughter</hi> or <hi>virgin,</hi> as was obſerved <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.8. And the <hi>ſpoyling</hi> here ſpoken of, was that which was made by <hi>Salmaneſer</hi> and his Army, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 17.5. at which time they beſieged <hi>Samaria,</hi> and vexed it with all hoſtility three years, and then over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came it.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> calls the <hi>people of the ten Tribes, her people,</hi> becauſe of the neerneſs of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and blood which was between them two; for the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>ten Tribes of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> were all the children of one man, even <hi>Jacob,</hi> who was alſo called <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be here objected, That it is a thing unlikely that the men of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould lament thus at the ſpoyling of the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (when they were ſpoyled by <hi>Salmaneſer</hi>) who would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rejoyce at it, and comfort themſelves in it, becauſe they were their bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> That which is here ſpoken of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> weeping, becauſe of <hi>the ſpoyling of the daughter of her people,</hi> was repreſented onely in a Viſion; and that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in a Viſion, is not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived always as a thing really and actually done.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe this to have been actually done, there would be no abſurdity in the ſuppoſition: For though the men of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the thoughts of the deſtruction of the ten Tribes, before this deſtruction came, yet might they lament it when it did come. So did the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> deſire to cut off the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> who when they had neer cut it off, were ſorry, and wept for what was done, <hi>Judg.</hi> 21.6.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might lament and weep, <hi>becauſe of the ſpoyling of the daughter of her people,</hi> becauſe ſhe her ſelf was in fear of being ſpoyled, while the daughter of her people was in ſpoyling.</p>

                  <p>It ſeemeth that <hi>Shebna,</hi> being of great honor in the Kings Court in his life-time, was deſirous of a glorious and magnificent Monument, in or neer to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after his death; but knowing that the wills of

                  <p>
                     <hi>Shebna</hi> was at this time adorned with a robe of honor, a robe befitting the chiefeſt man in the Kings Court, <hi>verſ:</hi> 21.

                  <p>The ſence therefore is, <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou art now clothed with a robe of honor, and a long robe, with a train appendant to it, which makes thee proud and high-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but then when the Lord ſhall carry thee away captive, he ſhall clothe thee with a witneſs: for he ſhall clothe thee as captives are clothed, <hi>that is,</hi> with baſe and ragged garments, and garments of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, garments which ſhall ſcarce cover thy buttocks, and that ſhall pull down thy proud and haughty minde.</p>
                  <p>But yet it may be that it is not this robe which the Prophet jerks at, but ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or covering, which <hi>Shebna</hi> out of his pride and ſtatelineſs might uſe, which might be gorgeous and as rich as could be bought or made, for the matter of it; and unuſual, and altogether affected, for the faſhion of it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words, <hi>And will ſurely cover thee,</hi> are to be read as it were with a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> and were occaſioned by that word <hi>capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> going next before them: For cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives uſed to wear clothes ſo ſhort, as would ſcarce cover their buttocks.

                  <p>The queſtion will be here, How and when this <hi>Shebna</hi> was carryed away cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive?</p>
                  <p>It is likely that this <hi>Shebna</hi> was put out of Court, and baniſhed the Land (being a ſtranger) or the City at leaſt, for ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure or other which the King concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved againſt him, probably for the reaſon mentioned in Notes, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.

                  <p>
                     <hi>There ſhalt thou dye,]</hi> Hence may that appear which I ſaid before, That this <hi>Shebna</hi> was not that <hi>Shebna</hi> which was Secretary to <hi>Hezekiah, Cap.</hi> 36. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. though he were of the ſame name.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there] i. e.</hi> And when thou art there, or then; for Adverbs of Place be ſometimes put for Adverbs of Time.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of thy glory,] i. e.</hi> Of thee which art now ſo glorious.</p>
                  <p>A mans glory may be ſometimes put, by a <hi>Metonymical Periphraſis,</hi> for a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; as a Kings Majeſty, for a King: and ſo may it be put here, yet not without a <hi>Sarcaſm</hi> or <hi>Irony.</hi>

                  <p>This ſignifieth the ſame thing as <hi>a nail faſtened in a ſure place</hi> did: For firſt, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a <hi>throne</hi> is a ſtately ſeat, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and lifted up aloft from the ground, it ſignifies the honor and high place that <hi>Eliakim</hi> ſhould have in the Kings Court. Secondly, Being that the <hi>throne</hi> is never wanting to the Palace, or the Kings Palace is never without the Throne; it ſignifies that <hi>Eliakim</hi> ſhould never be removed from the place which he had in the Kings Court. But thirdly, and that chiefly, As a <hi>throne</hi> ſuſtaineth him that ſitteth thereon, and he that ſitteth thereon ſitteth on high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a Throne is mounted aloft; it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that <hi>Eliakims</hi> kindred ſhould reſt upon him for honor and preferment, and he ſhould advance them every one: And for this chiefly was he ſaid to be <hi>a glorious throne to his fathers houſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, that <hi>thrones</hi> are onely the ſeats of <hi>Kings;</hi> and if <hi>Eliakim</hi> ſhould be as a <hi>throne</hi> to his kindred, it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that he ſhould make them Kings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> As <hi>thrones</hi> are the ſeats, ſo <hi>crowns</hi> are the wearing onely of Kings; yet, by a <hi>Metaphor, crowns</hi> are attributed to meaner men, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.4. and 14.24. and 16.31. and 17.6.

                  <p>There is a <hi>Metaphor</hi> in the word <hi>found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> for becauſe a houſe is built and the foundations thereof laid, that it might be an habitation for man.</p>
                  <p>Therefore is the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> ſaid here to <hi>found, that is,</hi> to lay the foundations of the Land of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> for theſe men to dwell in, becauſe he provided it for them, and gave it to them for a dwelling place.</p>
                  <p>Note, that it was the manner of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi> when they vanquiſhed any Land, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the old Inhabitants thereof out of it, into ſome remote Countries, and to bring farre dwellers to dwell there.

The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> therefore when they had vanquiſhed the Land of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans,</hi> did remove the antient Inhabitants thereof, and brought them which dwelt in the Wilderneſs before, to dwell there in their roome.</p>

                  <p>By theſe words he ſheweth what they were whom the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> brought into the Land of the <hi>Caldeans</hi> to dwell, when he carried the <hi>Caldeans</hi> thence, they were ſuch as lived in the Wilderneſs in Tents, like the <hi>Arabes Scenitae,</hi> and <hi>Scythians.</hi>

                  <p>Note here, that theſe words according to their right order, ſhould follow thoſe <hi>this people,</hi> and the order and ſence of this verſe hitherto is this, <hi>Behold the Land of the Caldeans, this people that dwelt firſt in the Wilderneſs, and now dwell in it, that is, in the Land of the Caldeans; was not in it, that is, in the Land of the Caldeans, till the Aſſyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an founded it for them.</hi>

                  <p>The ſence of this place is this, the <hi>Calde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> built ſtrong Towers of defence, and large Pallaces and Buildings in their Land, and rooted themſelves there; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their towers of defence, and their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:101476:107"/> Pallaces, the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> brought their Land to ruine.</p>
                  <p>That which the Prophet ſaith here is this, that the <hi>Caldeans</hi> were an antient people, and had in their Land many Towers of defence, and large Buildings of ſtrength; yet notwithſtanding the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> did van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh them, and deſtroy their Land.

                  <p>Note, <hi>That the breaking of this Covenant</hi> was no more then the tranſgreſſion of the Laws, and changing and not obſerving of the Ordinances; wherefore he doth repeat here in other words what he ſaid before, the more to exaggerate their ſin.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> did worſhip the Sun and the Moon and the Stars, and made Images and repreſentations thereof, which alſo they worſhipped and carryed about with them in their Camp; and theſe Images or repreſentations were deſtroyed when <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherihs</hi> Army was deſtroyed: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were deſtroyed, <hi>the hoſt of the high ones that are on high, that is,</hi> the Sun and the Moon and the Stars themſelves are here ſaid to be puniſhed: So the Lord was ſaid to execute Judgment upon all the gods of <hi>Egypt, Exod.</hi> 12.12. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 33.4.

                  <p>But you will ſay, (whether by <hi>the hoſt of the high ones that are on high,</hi> are meant the Sun, the Moon and the Stars, or the Images or Repreſentations onely thereof,) Nothing can be ſaid properly to be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ſuch as is endued with Reaſon: But neither the hoſt of Heaven, nor their Images have any reaſon, Therefore they cannot properly be ſaid to be puniſhed.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> This therefore, that they are ſaid to be puniſhed, is <hi>Metaphorical,</hi> as ſenſe and reaſon is Metaphorically given to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols, <hi>cap.</hi> 19.1. Or ſecondly, (this being put as a calamity of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi>) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet may ſpeak according to the ſenſe and thoughts of the <hi>Aſſyrians:</hi> Now the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> which worſhipped the Sun and the Moon and the hoſt of Heaven, thinking them to be gods, thought that they had underſtanding, and that as they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the Images and Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were made of them, and with the honor and worſhip which was given to thoſe their Images and Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: So they thought that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily affected and grieved, when their Images and Repreſentations were contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliouſly uſed, and diſgracefully broken.</p>
                  <p>Note, that the Prophet ſaith here, that <hi>the Lord ſhall puniſh the hoſt of the high ones that are on high,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped them, and relied on them for their good ſucceſs, as in all other their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes, ſo in this againſt <hi>Judah.</hi>

                  <p>This I do conceive to be the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable meaning of this place: and that as the Prophet did prophecy againſt the men of <hi>Judah,</hi> verſ. 17, 18, 19, 20. and comfort them again with the deſtruction of their Enemies, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21.

                  <p>The onely Objection which can be made againſt this expoſition is, That there is no mention here of the men of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that there is no Nominative caſe to theſe Verbs, but what is in the former verſe.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer; That the Prophet might point as it were with his finger at the men of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when he ſpoke of them, and ſo he needed not to name them, his pointing at them might be enough to ſignifie whom he meant.</p>
                  <p>Again, as he doth often put a <hi>Relative</hi> without an <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and leaves the <hi>Antecedent</hi> to be underſtood by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the place; ſo might he leave the <hi>Nominative</hi> caſe which ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Verb to be underſtood: Examples whereof we have <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.3. and 23.5. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.22. and 4.36. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Wo to the Crown of Pride,]</hi> The Crown which he here ſpeaks of was ſuch a Crown or Garland of Roſes, and other fair flowers as Drunkards were wont to uſe, and to wear upon their heads in their drinkings; which crown he cals here <hi>a Crown of Pride, that is,</hi> a proud Crown; by a <hi>Metaphor,</hi> becauſe of the beauty and gayneſſe of it.</p>
                  <p>This was firſt invented and uſed by the Heathen, and of them did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> learn it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Pride,] That is,</hi> Proud or gay.</p>
                  <p>He puts here a <hi>Subſtantive</hi> of the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive caſe, for an <hi>Adjective.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>this Crown</hi> he means thoſe Drunkards of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of whom he here ſpeaks, and that either becauſe they wore ſuch a crown (as the Heathen did) in their drinkings; or becauſe as the Crown is wore upon the head, ſo were they ſeated upon the head of the fat vallies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To the Drunkards of Ephraim] i. e.</hi> To the Drunkards of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He explains here what he meant by the Crown of pride.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of Ephraim,] i. e.</hi> Of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or of the Ten Tribes.</p>

                  <p>By this is ſignified, that the eſtate of theſe men which here he ſpeakes of (though it might ſeem glorious) yet ſhould quickly decay, with all its glory.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>the head of the fat vallies,</hi> he meaneth <hi>Samaria,</hi> which was ſcituate on a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or Hill, beneath which were moſt fruitfull vallies, abounding with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, and Olive-yards.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>mountain</hi> or high hill may be ſaid to be the <hi>head of the vallies</hi> which are about it; for where the earth riſeth up <hi>into a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> it is ſaid to lift up its head; and if the mountain be a head, it muſt be the head of ſuch parts of the earth as are below it, and ſuch are vallies.</p>
                  <p>In the word <hi>head,</hi> he ſeemeth to have an alluſion to the <hi>Crown of Pride</hi> which he ſpoke of, which was wore on the head; by which <hi>Crown</hi> alſo he meant the <hi>Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards of Ephraim.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Of thoſe which are overcome with wine.]</hi> Of thoſe which are daily drunk with wine.</p>
                  <p>This is the common interpretation of theſe words, by which he doth obliquely tax other of the Ten Tribes, then thoſe which dwelt in <hi>Samaria,</hi> for their drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs.</p>
                  <p>But what if we ſhould interpret <hi>them which are overcome with wine,</hi> of ſuch as had ſo much wine (in the grape) as they could not make?</p>
                  <p>Surely ſuch may be ſaid to be overcome with wine, for we have more work then we can do, we ſay that we have more work then we can overcome, and that our work
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:101476:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> hath overcome us; and this interpretation will very well agree with this place, and will ſhew the fatneſs and fruitfulneſs of theſe vallies, in that they bring forth more grapes, then the husband-man is able to preſs and make wine of.</p>

                     <hi>This is the Reſt wherewith ye may cauſe the weary to reſt,] q. d.</hi> This which I teach you is the Truth of God, wherewith (when ye are inſtructed) ye may inſtruct thoſe which are in error, and deſire to come to the knowledge of the Truth, and bring them out of that their Error, to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth.</p>
                  <p>This is the meaning of theſe words, which were ſpoken to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> as they were Prieſts and Prophets; <hi>that is,</hi> as they were by their Calling <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Inſtructers</hi> of the people, and who (as they had erred themſelves at this time, and cauſed the people to err by their Errors, ſo) might have learned the Truth themſelves, and have inſtructed the people alſo therein, and by that have brought them out of their Errors, if they would have harkened.</p>
                  <p>For the farther underſtanding of the words, know, that the words are (if not <hi>Proverbial,</hi> yet) <hi>Allegorical,</hi> and that the <hi>Allegory</hi> is taken from travellers, and that by occaſion of that, that we call <hi>falſhood, error;</hi> and ſay of him which is of a falſe Opinion, and holdeth that which is falſe, That he <hi>erreth,</hi> and is out of the way, as Verſ. 7.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, The <hi>holding of a falſe Tenent,</hi> or being of a <hi>falſe judgment,</hi> is likened to the <hi>erring</hi> or <hi>ſtraying</hi> of a traveller out of his way.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The man which ſeeth that he is in a falſe Opinion, and deſireth to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Truth, is compared to a Traveller which knoweth he is out of the way, and is <hi>weary</hi> with wandering out of his way: For as ſuch Traveller is weary
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:101476:124"/> of his wandering; ſo is ſuch a man weary of his Error, which ſeeth his Error, and deſireth to come to the knowledge of the Truth; for his deſire to come to the knowledge of the Truth, ſheweth, that he is <hi>weary</hi> of his Error: for a deſire of change argueth a <hi>wearineſs</hi> of our preſent condition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The knowledge of the Truth is compared to the <hi>Reſt</hi> which the Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler findes when he is <hi>weary;</hi> for as <hi>reſt</hi> ſets an end to the Travellers former wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſo doth the knowledge of the <hi>Truth</hi> to his erring and going out of the way, who was in an Error before.</p>
                  <p>Now the words being thus <hi>allegorized,</hi> may be thus expounded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This is the Reſt,] i. e.</hi> This is the Truth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Wherewith ye may cauſe the weary to reſt,]</hi> Wherewith ye may cauſe thoſe which have erred and are weary of their Errors, to reſt from that wearineſs, by bringing them to the knowledge of the Truth, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And this is the refreſhing,] Supple,</hi> With which ye may refreſh them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words are the very ſame, for ſence, with the foregoing words: But yet, if you think <hi>refreſhing</hi> ſignifieth more then <hi>reſt,</hi> interpret it of the <hi>delight,</hi> which Truth, being known, bringeth along with it, beſides the <hi>reſt</hi> or ceſſation which it brings from erring.</p>

                     <hi>Yet they would not hear,] i. e.</hi> Yet they would not harken to the voyce of the Lord, who offered thus to inſtruct them in the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Note, that theſe words, <hi>This is the Reſt,</hi> are not ſo to be underſtood, as if God had uſed theſe formal words to theſe men: but the meaning is this, That God would have taught theſe men his Truth, but they would not be taught it.</p>

                  <p>He alludes to a man which is upon an hill, or ſome eminent or high place, in the time of a flood: For they which are on an <hi>hill,</hi> or in ſome <hi>high place,</hi> whither the flood comes not, are ſafe, whereas all are ſwept away and drowned which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of the waters.</p>

Laſt of all, he ſpeaks of theſe <hi>lyes Metaphorically,</hi> as of a place, whither a man flies, when he perceives a ſtorm riſing, to ſave himſelf from the ſtorm: becauſe they thought by their <hi>lyes</hi> to ſave themſelves from the fury of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> as a man ſaves himſelf from a ſtorm by a <hi>covert</hi> or <hi>hiding place,</hi> which he makes his <hi>refuge</hi> to flee to.</p>

                  <p>Note here, that the Prophet paſſeth from one <hi>Metaphor</hi> to another, from the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of a flood and a ſcourge, &amp;c. to the <hi>Metaphor</hi> of a ſtorm, and a refuge from the ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that when the Prophet brings theſe men in, ſaying, <hi>We have made lyes our refuge, and under falſhood have we hid our ſelves;</hi> he ſpeaks rather as the Truth was, and as he interpreted it, then as they ſpoke; for they would not have called

                  <p>Yet becauſe, in the ſecond and more ſublime ſence, this <hi>foundation</hi> is interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. We may inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, and perhaps with more probability, this of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who, as in other things, and elſewhere, he is a Type of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſo may he be in this, and here: And <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> may be ſaid to be layd in <hi>Sion</hi> for a foundation, becauſe he was the <hi>foundation</hi> of ſafety againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to all which remained in <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> For God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſave <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all that kept themſelves within her for <hi>his</hi> ſake: and he might be well called the <hi>foundation</hi> of that ſafety, of which he was ſo principal a <hi>Cauſe,</hi> by a <hi>Metaphor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſtone,]</hi> He means ſuch a ſtone which uſed to be layd for a <hi>foundation</hi> of a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is great and durable.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>A precious corner ſtone,] i. e.</hi> A corner ſtone, or chief ſtone of great worth: And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might be called a precious corner ſtone, becauſe of his great vertues.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Hebrew</hi> dialect, <hi>the corner</hi> ſignifieth that part of a building which by its own ſtrength alone ſuſtaineth and upholdeth the whole ſtructure: Hence <hi>Magistrates</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> which are the props and uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Commonwealth, are called <hi>the corners, Judg.</hi> 20.2. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.38. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 19.13. <hi>The corner ſtone</hi> therefore, in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> phraſe, is as much as a <hi>ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation-ſtone:</hi> So that all theſe words, <hi>A ſtone, a tryed ſtone, a corner ſtone,</hi> ſignifie but one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſure foundation,] Hezekiah</hi> might be called <hi>a ſure foundation,</hi> becauſe as a <hi>ſure foundation</hi> cannot eaſily be ſhaken or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown; ſo <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could not be ſhaken in his faith by the threats of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> nor could the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, overthrow him, or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which God had given him) by force of Arms.</p>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:101476:125"/> with a mighty Army: nor will he make haſte to comply with the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and make his peace with them, as many others did; but will abide in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhall be ſafe there.</p>
                  <p>What is ſpoken here of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſence, is ſpoken of our Saviour <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>ſecond</hi> and more <hi>ſublime</hi> ſence, as appears 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.33. For (as we have often obſerved, and ſhall often obſerve) the temporal deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> was a <hi>type</hi> of the ſpiritual deliverance of the <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> As therefore the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral deliverance of the <hi>Jews</hi> was a type of the ſpiritual deliverance of the <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> So they which were any way the cauſe of the temporal deliverance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were a <hi>type</hi> of Chriſt our Saviour, ſo far forth as they were the cauſes of that temporal deliverance: And the Holy Ghoſt, while it ſpeaks of them, doth ſo order the words of the Scripture, as that the ſame words which are ſpoke of them, may oftentimes be applyed to <hi>Chriſt</hi> alſo, yea oftentimes be more properly applyed to <hi>Chriſt</hi> then to them.</p>

Becauſe that Altar did devoure the Beaſts which were ſacrificed thereon, as a ſtrong Lion devoureth his prey: from this Altar the whole City of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is here called <hi>Ariel,</hi> by a <hi>Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The City where David dwelt,]</hi> This is a Periphraſe of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for <hi>David</hi> when he had took the ſtrong hold of <hi>Sion,</hi> which is in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from the <hi>Jebuſites,</hi> he dwelt in it, and called it the City of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.7, 9. And there he reigned three and thirty yeares, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.11.</p>
                  <p>The Prophet gives this Periphraſe of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that it might be the better known what he meant by <hi>Ariel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Add ye year to year,] q.d.</hi> Add ye yearly feaſt to yearly feaſt, one yearly feaſt to another; as the feaſt of <hi>weeks,</hi> to the feaſt of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened Bread;</hi> and the feaſt of <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> to the feaſt of <hi>weeks;</hi> and keep them with joy and mirth one after another.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>year</hi> is put here by a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> for the yearly feaſt, or feaſt which is kept once every year. As the <hi>new Moons</hi> are taken for the ſolemnities (as I may call them) which were wont to be uſed the firſt day of every month, at the change of the Moon. <hi>Cap.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p>Three times in the year were all the Males of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to appear before the Lord, in the place which he ſhould chuſe, in the feaſt of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleavened Bread,</hi> and in the feaſt of <hi>weeks,</hi> and in the feaſts of <hi>Tabernacles, Deut.</hi> 16.16. And of theſe doth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſeem here to ſpeak, and it is likely that he denounced this propheſie againſt <hi>Ariel,</hi> at one of theſe feaſts, at which time the people were full of mirth and joy; not without confidence of their outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances and obſervations of theſe feaſts, though inwardly they were full of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                  <p>Note, that the Prophet uſeth an <hi>Ironical conceſſion</hi> in theſe words, the like whereof you may read, <hi>cap.</hi> 50.11.</p>
                  <p>Some interpret theſe words thus, <hi>adde ye a year to a year,</hi> as if it had been the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets intent to ſhew, that after a year and a year, <hi>that is,</hi> after two years the calamity which is here propheſied againſt <hi>Ariel,</hi> ſhould befall <hi>Ariel.</hi>

                  <p>He ſpeaks eſpecially of the ſacrifices of <hi>Peace-Offerings;</hi> the fleſh whereof they were to eat, and to rejoyce before the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.7.</p>
                  <p>Note here the <hi>Enallage</hi> of the perſon, from the ſecond to the third.</p>

                  <p>The Prophet did often propheſie of this ſiege of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> as he did alſo of other things which he did the more to ſhew <hi>the providence of God.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>By <hi>Ariel</hi> may be meant here <hi>the Altar of Burnt-offerings</hi> which was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the reaſon given <hi>v.</hi> 1. And the ſenſe of this place may be this, <hi>q. d.</hi> And as in a day of ſolemnity, many Carcaſes of Beaſts (which are to be ſacrificed) lye dead upon the ground about the Altar of Burnt-offerings; ſo ſhall many carcaſes and dead bodies of men lye about <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many carcaſes of dead men might lye about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when it was beſieged by
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:101476:128"/> the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> becauſe many of the <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomitans</hi> which were ſet to defend the wals, might be ſlain with arrows and ſlings, &amp;c. upon the walls; and many again might be ſlain upon ſallies out of the City upon the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, many dead bodies might lye about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe many which dwelt in the Towns and Villages about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the ſuburbs thereof, which were friends to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and were now ſacrificing and making merry at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> might be ſlain by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in their ſeveral towns and villages about <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs thereof, whoſe deaths might be as grievous to the men of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as the deaths of their own Citizens.</p>
                  <p>Or, by <hi>Ariel</hi> we may underſtand <hi>a ſtrong Lion,</hi> (for ſo this word <hi>Ariel</hi> ſignifies by interpretation) and the ſenſe of this place may be this, <hi>q. d.</hi> And as a ſtrong Lion (when he is perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Anſwer.

But while theſe Princes lay before <hi>Jeruſalom, Sennacherib</hi> himſelfe was with another part of his Army in other parts of the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> as at <hi>Lachiſh</hi> firſt, and at <hi>Libnah</hi> afterwards, <hi>cap.</hi> 37. <hi>v.</hi> 8.

                  <p>Note here, that though the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Your turning things upſide down ſhall be eſteemed as the Potters clay;</hi> yet his intent is not to liken <hi>the turning of things upſide down</hi> to the <hi>Potters clay,</hi> but <hi>the men which turned</hi> thoſe things upſide down: For in Parables and ſimilitudes we muſt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole body of the ſentence, and take the meaning from the whole, not from any one piece. See what is ſaid <hi>cap.</hi> 17.5. and 30.13. to this purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that when he ſaith, that they <hi>are as the Potters clay; that is,</hi> that they are Gods creatures, and the work of his hands; his meaning is, that God knows all their thoughts and actions: For Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity teacheth us thus much, That if <hi>God made us, God knows all our doings, Pſal.</hi> 94.9, 10.</p>

                  <p>By thinking they could <hi>hide their counſel from God,</hi> they did in effect ſay, <hi>That God made them not.</hi>

                     <hi>Or ſhall the thing framed ſay of him that framed it, He had no underſtanding?] q. d.</hi> Or if the veſſel doth acknowledge that it was framed by the hand of the Potter, ſhall it ſay of him that framed it, <hi>He had no underſtanding?

                  </p>
                  <p>Note here, that they which think that they can hide their works and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels from the Lord, do not acknowledge that God is their Maker, nor that he is their Overſeer; wherefore they are like a Potters veſſel which lifts up it ſelf againſt the Potter, and ſaith, <hi>Thou didſt not make me, Thou haſt no knowledge or underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of me.</hi>

                  <p>Note alſo, that theſe words, <hi>For ſhall the work ſay of him that made it, &amp;c.</hi> are not ſo much a reaſon to prove, that they were as the Potters clay, <hi>that is,</hi> that they were the work of Gods hands, as a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of them which thought they were not as the Potters clay, <hi>that is,</hi> which thought not that they were the work of Gods hand.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Note here alſo, that <hi>fruitful fields</hi> are for the moſt part in valleys: Hence <hi>per Metonymiam adjuncti,</hi> we muſt underſtand a valley here by the fruitful field; and by the valley here we muſt underſtand <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically</hi> a low condition, or men in a low condition, becauſe valleys lie low.</p>
                  <p>The ſence therefore of this place is this, <hi>q. d.</hi> But for all that, that you will not believe that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> which ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiege <hi>Ariel</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed, O ye Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Rulers and Seers, which take ſuch ſecret counſel to ſave your ſelves; yet it ſhall not be long before the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which are high in power and riches, and are very proud, and ſhall beſiege <hi>Ariel,</hi> that is, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſhall be brought very low, and be deſtroyed, and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and flouriſh again.</p>
                  <p>This is that which theſe men did moſt diſ-believe, to wit, the preſervation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> ſhould once lay ſiege unto it, and the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians;</hi> which makes the Prophet here to enforce it again, and confirm what he ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And the fruitful field ſhall be eſteemed as a forreſt,] i. e.</hi> And the fruitful field ſhall be as a forreſt.</p>
                  <p>Though many things <hi>are not</hi> ſuch as they are <hi>eſteemed</hi> to be, yet many things again <hi>are</hi> ſuch as they <hi>are eſteemed</hi> to be.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>the fruitful field</hi> is here meant <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically</hi> the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by them diſtreſſed and brought into a very low condition: for fruitful fields are in valleys, and valleys lie very low.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>a forreſt</hi> is meant determinately the forreſt of <hi>Lebanon,</hi> which was ſcituate on an Hill; or at leaſt ſome forreſt which was ſcituate on high, as the forreſt of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon</hi> was: And by that or ſuch a forreſt is <hi>metaphorically</hi> meant an happy eſtate or condition; a condition which is high, and a great deal above miſery; a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion oppoſite to that which we call a <hi>low condition,</hi> or elſe men which are in ſuch an high condition.</p>

                  <p>Some think that the Prophet alludes to a man correcting his ſon or his ſervant with a rod, who ſtretcheth out his arm and lifteth up his whole body, and ſtandeth on tip-toe, that he may fetch the greater ſtroke; but the higher he lifteth up himſelf, and the further he ſtretcheth out his arm, the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he is before he ſtrikes; from whom <hi>to be exalted,</hi> or <hi>to exalt himſelf,</hi> may be taken (ſay they) for to <hi>defer a puniſhment,</hi> or to be long before he ſtrikes, by a <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Others ſay thus, When God is about to puniſh, he is ſaid <hi>to come out of his place,</hi> (which is heaven) as <hi>cap.</hi> 26.21. and <hi>Mic.</hi> 1.3. That therefore he might puniſh this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he came as it were out of heaven; but becauſe he would not then puniſh them, but ſpare them a little longer; he returned on high into Heaven to his place again. Hence <hi>to be exalted</hi> (that is, to return on high; or, to go up to Heaven) ſignifieth (they ſay) <hi>to deferre a puniſhment,</hi> and to ſpare a while.</p>
                  <p>Others ſay thus; When God doth any notable thing, he is ſaid <hi>to be exalted</hi> and <hi>glorified, (Per Metonymiam Effecti.)</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth that for which he may juſtly be exalted and glorified. (See <hi>cap.</hi> 12.4. and <hi>cap.</hi> 26.15.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe God was willing to ſhew his long-ſuffering and forbearance a while longer to his faithful people (which muſt needs redound to the praiſe and glory of God) The Prophet ſaith, <hi>he will be exalted,</hi> for <hi>he will ſuffer them and ſpare them a little longer; Per Metonymiam Effecti.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And the burden thereof is heavy,] q. d.</hi> and ſo heavy is his anger, as that the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians</hi> (againſt whom it is kindled) will not be able to bear it.

                     <hi>And his breath as an overflowing ſtream,]</hi> The breath of an angry man, while he ſtorms and rageth, proceeds like <hi>ſmoke</hi> from his mouth and his noſe, yea (as our Prophet ſaith here) like a <hi>ſtream:</hi> For as he takes in more ayr at ſuch a time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerate the heat of his heart; ſo doth he violently ſend out more again by reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, while he chafeth and ſtormeth.</p>
                  <p>But the Prophet doth not onely liken his breath to a <hi>ſtream,</hi> but to an <hi>overflowing ſtream; that is,</hi> to a ſtream of water, which by reaſon of Snow or Rain, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floweth its banks, and reacheth up to the middle of a mans neck, whereby the whole man is welnigh drowned.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words relate to thoſe, <hi>Behold the Name of the Lord cometh,</hi> and ſhew the end of his coming; <hi>q. d. The Name of the Lord cometh to ſift the Nations, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>This phraſe is <hi>metaphorical;</hi> for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of which obſerve, That when men <hi>ſift corn</hi> with a ſieve, that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the ſieve (which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nothing elſe but duſt and trumpery) is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:101476:138"/> caſt away, and ſo cometh to be troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot, as being unprofitable; and that onely is reſerved and ſet by, which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſieve after ſifting, which is the clean grain.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve ſecondly, That when we ſift corn, we ſift it for this end, that we may ſever the duſt and trumpery from the good corn or grain: Now if we ſift the corn in a broken ſieve, or a wide-hole ſieve, ſo that all paſſeth through, as well the corn and grain, as the duſt and trumpery, we ſpend our labor in vain; and ſuch a ſieve may be called a <hi>ſieve of vanity,</hi> or <hi>a vain ſieve,</hi> becauſe we loſe our labor in ſifting in it.</p>
                  <p>When therefore the Prophet ſaith, That he will ſift <hi>them with a ſieve of vanity,</hi> his meaning is, that he will ſift them in ſuch a ſieve, as lets all through which is put into it. And becauſe, when men uſually ſift corn, they fling away that which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth through the ſieve, and falleth to the Earth, and tread it under their feet; hence the Prophet ſaith, That <hi>the Lord will ſift the Nations with a ſieve of vanity,</hi> for <hi>he will deſtroy them, and tread them all under feet,</hi> joyning two <hi>Metaphors</hi> together.</p>

                     <hi>And there ſhall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,]</hi> Note, that the word <hi>people</hi> is of the plural number, and it ſignifies thoſe of divers people which were in <hi>Sennache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribs</hi> Army.</p>
                  <p>Note alſo, that whereas <hi>Sennacherib</hi> himſelf, though he was upon his way ſo far as <hi>Nob, Cap.</hi> 10.32. yet becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he himſelf came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to the ſiege, nor that part of his Army which was with him, I underſtand by <hi>the people</hi> here, that part of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> Army which was with <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> when that part of his Army which lay before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed: And theſe had <hi>a bridle in their jaws;</hi> for whereas they were haſting to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſtrengthen the ſiege, <hi>the Lord did put a hook into their noſe, and a bridle into their lips, and turned them back, Cap.</hi> 37.29. See <hi>cap.</hi> 31.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſing them to err,] i. e.</hi> Making them to flee, as a chaſed Roe, and as a ſheep which no man taketh up (as the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Cap.</hi> 13.14.) which err and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they know not whither, until they fall into ſome pit or other, or be devoured by ſome ravenous beaſt or other.</p>
                  <p>It is likely that when the news came to the ears of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and thoſe which were with him, of the ſlaughter of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fourſcore and five thouſand of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> in one night, that this turned them back from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted them, that they ran confuſedly, ſome one way, and ſome another, they knew not whither; and that many of them came ſhort home, they which hated them having opportunity to ſlay them, as they found them wandering and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited.</p>
                  <p>Note, that when the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The bridle in the jaws of the people ſhall cauſe them to err,</hi> he alludeth to that which was ſignified by the <hi>bridle,</hi> rather then to the <hi>bridle</hi> it ſelf; for <hi>bridles</hi> cauſe not to err, but to go right rather: But the news of an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand being ſlain in one night (which is that which was ſignified by the <hi>bridle,</hi> becauſe it turned <hi>Sennacherib</hi> from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as a <hi>bridle</hi> doth an Horſe) did make <hi>Senna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherib,</hi> and thoſe which were with him, to diſparkle, and run as chaſed Roes or wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſheep, they knew not whither.</p>
                  <p>That the Prophet doth ſometime allude in ſimilitudes to the thing ſignifying, and ſometimes to the thing ſignified. See <hi>Cap.</hi> 16.8. and 22.24.</p>
                  <p>Or when he ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, cauſing them to err;</hi> it is as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>There ſhall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,</hi> but <hi>a bridle of a ſtrange nature;</hi> for whereas other bridles cauſe the beaſts in whoſe jaws they are to go aright, this ſhall cauſe them in whoſe jaws it ſhall be to err. See the like Notes, <hi>Cap.</hi> 33.20.</p>

                  <p>And that fight or battel in which the <hi>Midianites</hi> were overcome, might be called <hi>a battel of ſhaking</hi> from ſome geſture which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> uſed at that time: for the <hi>Midianites</hi> were put to flight, not by the <hi>ſword,</hi> or any kinde of weapons of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> breaking of pitchers, holding lamps in their left hand, blowing the Trumpets which they had in their right hand, and crying, <hi>The ſword of the Lord and of Gideon, Judg.</hi> 7.20, 21, &amp;c. Now though it be not written in the ſtory, that when they cryed, <hi>The ſword of the Lord and of Gideon,</hi> they ſhook their lamps and their Trumpets which they had in their hands; yet it is more then probable, that they held them not ſtill, but ſhook them both, and waved them over their heads, or ſome other way, in confidence of the victory; from which motion or ſhaking of the Trumpets and Lamps, this battel might be called <hi>The battel of ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This battel might be alſo called <hi>The battel of ſhaking,</hi> for the great fear and trembling wherewith the <hi>Midianites</hi> were poſſeſſed; for though the <hi>Midianites</hi> and their aſſociates were like graſhoppers for multitude, and their Camels were without number, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.12. yet were they ſo terrified by three hundred men of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as that the whole hoſt ran, and cryed, and fled, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.21.</p>

                     <hi>Tophet] Tophet</hi> was a place neer <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in the valley of the ſon of <hi>Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.10. where the Idolaters were wont to offer their children by fire to <hi>Moloch;</hi> and it was called <hi>Tophet</hi> from <hi>Toph,</hi> which ſignifieth a Drum, becauſe they were wont to beat Drums while their children were burning in the fire, to drown the lamentable noiſe and cry which they made.</p>
                  <p>Here did a great body of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> encamp, when they beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and here were many of them ſlain, and all or moſt buried, as it is probable.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea for the King it is prepared,] i. e.</hi> Yea, it is prepared for <hi>Sennacherib</hi> King of <hi>Aſsy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, that is,</hi> for his Hoſt or for his Army: for that which is prepared for the houſehold or Army of a King, is ſaid to be prepared for the King himſelf, by a <hi>Metonymy:</hi> Or, the <hi>King</hi> may be put <hi>Collativè,</hi> for the <hi>Kings;</hi> that is, for the Captains of <hi>Senacheribs</hi> Army, for they were moſt Kings; and by the Kings and Captains may be meant all that were under their command too; by a <hi>Syllepſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by whom was <hi>Tophet</hi> prepared, and how, and for what end?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It was prepared by <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> and it was prepared by removing thence the Image of <hi>Moloch,</hi> and the Altar and other Inſtruments of Idolatry which were there, by which more roome was made, and by which it was able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and contain more men then before it was; and it was prepared for this end and purpoſe, that the <hi>Aſsyrians</hi> which beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might there encamp, and might there be ſlain (a great part of them) and might there, all or moſt that were ſlain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (which were one hundred fourſcore and five thouſand) have roome enough to be buried in.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of which, note that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> when he came firſt to the Crown, removed the high places, brake down the Images, cut down the Groves, and deſtroyed all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Idolatry, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. Now a noted place of Idolatry was <hi>Tophet,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.10. this therefore <hi>Hezekiah</hi> purged, and broke down the Idols, and the Altars, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:101476:140"/> all other the Inſtruments of Idolatry which were ſet up and uſed there, and cauſed them to be carryed thence and deſtroyed, whereby there was more roome, and more of <hi>Sennacheribs</hi> men encamped there, then otherwiſe could have done, and ſo more were ſlain there by the Angel, and more roome there was to bury thoſe which were ſlain by the Angel in that place; by reaſon therefore of this the Prophet ſaith, that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet was prepared for the King, that is,</hi> for the Army and Captains of the King, the King of <hi>Aſsyria,</hi> and this he ſaith not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had this in his minde, when he purged <hi>Tophet,</hi> but becauſe it happened out as pat as if he had purged it and made roome in it, for that purpoſe: The like kind of phraſe to this, we read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>v.</hi> 12. where our Saviour ſaith, that the woman which poured ointment there upon his body, did it <hi>for his burial;</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the woman had any ſuch intent, but becauſe ſhe did it as opportunely for his burial, as if ſhe had intended it for that end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He hath made it deep and large,] i. e. Hezekiah</hi> hath made therein very much room, by removing the Idols and Altars, and other inſtruments of Idolatry out of it.</p>
                  <p>Here is a <hi>Relative</hi> without an <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He alludes here to the making of a pit or grave (wherein dead bodies are buried) when he ſaith, <hi>He hath made it deep and large:</hi> And therefore doth he ſeem to make this alluſion, becauſe the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> which were ſlain by the Angel, were all, or moſt, buried in <hi>Tophet,</hi> as is probable. Or elſe he alludeth here to the making of a priſon or dungeon under ground: And therefore may he allude to that, becauſe that place was as a priſon to the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> which pitched their Camp there, out of which place they could no more eſcape, then a priſoner out of a priſon or dunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; becauſe God had determined that they ſhould not eſcape thence, till he had deſtroyed them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The pile thereof is fire and much wood,] q. d.</hi> There is a pile in it, and that <hi>pile</hi> is very great, conſiſting of fire and much wood.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Tophet</hi> was employed to Idolatry, and <hi>Moloch</hi> was there worſhipped, there was a <hi>pile</hi> or <hi>piles of wood</hi> there continually provided, to burn their children withall to <hi>Moloch:</hi> To this <hi>pile</hi> or <hi>piles of wood</hi> doth the Prophet here allude, and ſaith, that the <hi>pile of Tophet,</hi> which is prepared for the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> to burn them up, and conſume them (as the children of Idolaters were wont to be burned to <hi>Moloch</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed) is very great: by which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſignifies, either that the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> which beſieged <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by fire (which is according to the Tradition of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>) or that they ſhould be deſtroyed as ſuddenly as if it were by fire (as others are of opinion:) So that herein is a double alluſion, firſt, to the <hi>pile of wood,</hi> which was wont to be provided here for the ſacrificing of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: ſecondly, to the manner of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> by the Angel, which was by fire, or as in as quick a manner, as if it had been done by fire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The breath of the Lord like a ſtream of brimstone doth kindle it.]</hi> By this he denoteth the anger of the Lord againſt the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> and ſpeaketh of God as of an angry man, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>A <hi>Tabernacle</hi> is of that condition, as that it may be ſtretched out, and folded up, pitcht and taken down again; wherefore we read both in ſacred and prophane writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that onely Shepheards, Soldiers, and Pilgrims, and wandring people, ſuch as the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi> were, and ſuch like make uſe of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> becauſe they could ſet them up over night, and take them down in the morning, and remove them from place to place; though this be the condition of a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and the Prophet calls <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a Tabernacle, yet ſaith he, it ſhall not be a Tabernacle of this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be a Tabernacle, but a Tabernacle of a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion contrary to the condition of ordinary Tabernacles; for whereas other Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are moveable, this ſhall not be moved, ſo ſaith he, <hi>cap.</hi> 30.28. <hi>There ſhall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,</hi> (but a bridle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the condition and uſe of other bridles, for it ſhall be <hi>a bridle) cauſing them to erre.</hi>

                  <p>It is frequent with God to promiſe and threaten in termes which <hi>ſeem abſolute,</hi> but include a <hi>Condition,</hi> or have an exception tacitly involved: which condition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception the Lord concealeth, that they whom the Promiſe or Threat concerneth, may be the more earneſt with the Lord, to haſten his Promiſe, or remove his Threats.</p>

                  <p>Note here <hi>firſt,</hi> that holy men did ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make mention of their good deeds before the Lord, in their prayers to him, as did <hi>Nehemiah, Nehem.</hi> 13.14. and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:101476:162"/> 
                     <hi>Jeremiah, Jerem.</hi> 15.15. and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> here.</p>
                  <p>Note <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that when they did make mention of their good deeds before the Lord, they did it for the moſt part when they were in troubles and tribulation.</p>
                  <p>Note <hi>thirdly,</hi> that though they did make mention of their <hi>good deeds,</hi> they did not mention them as <hi>meritorious</hi> cauſes of what they prayed for: And this is plain by <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who when he had in the fifth and ſixth Chapter of his Book, and in the thirteenth Chapter and fourteenth verſe, and elſe-where, entreated the Lord that he would remember him, <hi>according to his good deeds;</hi> in the thirteenth Chapter, and the two and twentieth verſe, he ſaith, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me, O my God, concerning this alſo, and ſpare me according to the greatneſſe of thy mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note <hi>fourthly,</hi> that the reaſon why they mention their good deeds at ſuch time is, <hi>firſt,</hi> That they might the more incline the Lord to mercy; For the Lord is more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to ſhew mercy to thoſe which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to live according to his Laws, then to thoſe which neglect them. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that they might ſuſtain themſelves againſt the Puſillanimity and faint-heartedneſſe which might aſſaile them, being prone by nature thereto: for the teſtimony of a good Conſcience produceth boldneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</p>
                  <p>But beſides theſe, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might have a ſpeciall reaſon to move him to mention his good deeds, and that is <hi>this,</hi> becauſe the Lord made a promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If thy Children take heed to their way to walke before me in truth with all their heart, and with all their ſoule, there ſhall not faile thee, a man on the Throne of Iſrael,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.4. And at this time <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had not a Childe to ſucceed him in the Throne.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And Hezekiah wept ſore.] viz.</hi> Becauſe God had ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou ſhalt dye and not live, v.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>It may be asked here, why <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould weep ſore, to hear that he ſhould dye?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> A generall reaſon may be this: Becauſe in the time of the Law (in which <hi>Hezekiah</hi> lived) the hope of eternall life was not ſo great as it is under the Goſpel; becauſe the glory to come was not ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed then as it is now, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.5. therefore was death more feared then now it is. But beſides this, <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might have many particular reaſons for which he wept at the hearing of his death. As <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe if he ſhould dye, then he ſhould leave <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and danger of <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> and muſt not ſee the delivery of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no <hi>Sonne</hi> as yet to ſucceed him in his Throne. And it might be a cauſe of ſorrow to him, to think that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.25. ſhould not appertain to him and his poſterity: yea it is inbred by Nature even in good men, to grieve to think that they ſhould dye Childleſſe, and that their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance ſhould come to ſtrangers. See an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this in <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.2. Adde to this, that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> knew that the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> was to ariſe out of the ſeed of <hi>David:</hi> therefore if he ſhould live to have iſſue, he might hope that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> might ariſe out of that, from which hope he ſhould be cut off, by dying at this time. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he might imagine, that they which had aſcribed the calamities of his times to him, becauſe he brake downe the Altars and the Images, &amp;c. might be more bold to aſcribe it to him, if he ſhould now dye, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers would be more prone to believe them, as if his ſinne in this had haſtened his death. <hi>Fiftly,</hi> He might think that God did intend to cut him off in diſpleaſure, (which could not be but grievous to him to think of) becauſe the Prophet came as Gods Herald to threaten him with death: And for this reaſon perhaps among the reſt, he doth here mention, how <hi>he had walked before God in truth, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>In this Verſe the Prophet ſheweth the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>might</hi> of God; And that he doth two ways: Firſt, by deſcribing God as a <hi>man of a vaſt ſtature,</hi> which he doth while he ſaith that he meaſured the waters in the <hi>hollow of his hand,</hi> and meted out the Heavens with <hi>a ſpan, &amp;c.</hi> And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by telling that the Lord made Heaven and Earth, which he doth while he telleth us that he <hi>meaſured</hi> the Waters, and the duſt of the Earth, and <hi>meted</hi> the Heavens, and <hi>weighed</hi> the hills and the mountains.</p>
                  <p>Note, that when God created all things, he created them in <hi>meaſure,</hi> and <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>weight,</hi> as the Wiſe-man ſpeaks, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 11.20.

                  <p>The Prophet ſpeaks here of the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as of an <hi>Impriſonment,</hi> and compares the <hi>Land of their captivity</hi> to a <hi>priſon;</hi> both becauſe they could no more get out thence, then a <hi>priſoner</hi> can get out of a <hi>priſon:</hi> as alſo, becauſe it was as <hi>irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom</hi> to them, as a <hi>priſon</hi> is to a <hi>priſoner.</hi> Yea, it may be that many of them were ſhut up in <hi>houſes,</hi> and there kept to hard work, as in <hi>priſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Prophet is therefore ſaid to bring the <hi>priſoners</hi> out of <hi>priſon,</hi> that is, the <hi>Jews</hi> out of their captivity, becauſe he did by his <hi>admonitions</hi> bring the <hi>Jews</hi> to think of the <hi>Covenant</hi> which they had broken, and the ſins which they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and bewail them, and amend their lives, and renew their <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, which moved God to free them, and deliver them out of captivity, and bring them to their own Land again.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was dead before the <hi>Jews</hi> were carryed <hi>captive into Babylon,</hi> which was a long time before their <hi>delivery</hi> thence; How then could he ſo admoniſh them, as that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them of their ſins, and amend their lives, and renew their <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, by his <hi>Admonitions,</hi> and ſo move God to deliver them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though <hi>Iſaiah</hi> were dead, yet might he be ſaid to <hi>admoniſh them,</hi> becauſe of his <hi>Writings,</hi> which he directed to them by a <hi>Prophetique Spirit.</hi> So <hi>Moſes,</hi> though he was dead many years before, was ſaid to <hi>command</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> which lived in our Saviours time, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.3. And ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> called themſelves <hi>Moſes's Diſciples, Joh.</hi> 9.28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And them that ſit in darkneſs out of the priſon houſe.]</hi> Though <hi>darkneſs</hi> be often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times put figuratively, for <hi>miſery</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction;</hi> yet I conceive that the Prophet alludeth here to <hi>priſons</hi> which uſe to be <hi>dark,</hi> having but <hi>few windows,</hi> and thoſe ſmall ones too, that the walls of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon might be the ſtronger; and eſpecially to <hi>Dungeons,</hi> which are under ground.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>What is here ſpoken, ſome underſtand literally, <hi>to wit,</hi> That as God gave the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> water in the Wilderneſs (which he brought out of a Rock, and made run down like Rivers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.17.) when he brought them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi>

                  <p>That which the Prophet ſpake in the former verſe, he ſpake in the perſon of the Lord: But that which he ſpeaketh here, and to the end of the Chapter he ſeemeth to ſpeak in his own perſon, and what he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth here, he ſpeaketh to perſwade all the ends of the Earth, to looke unto the Lord that they may be ſaved, and not to looke unto Idols, (as he did in the former verſe) But the Arguments which he here uſeth are not ſo tart, but of a more gentle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the argument which he uſed in verſe 23.</p>

                  <p>This, from this place to the end of the Chapter may be well accounted as part of the former Sermon, or at leaſt it may be well joyned with it for the principall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this is to ſhew, what proſperity ſhould befall the <hi>Jewes</hi> after the Arme of <hi>Cyrus</hi> had beene upon the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> And the former Sermon ended with that, that the Arme of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſhould be upon the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi> and proſper.</p>

                  <p>That which the Prophet ſpeakes here from this place to the end of the verſe, is not that which he chiefly bids them heare, (for that followeth in verſe 17.) but it is a Prooemiall ſpeech, to win their attention, and to make them the more to heed, what he hath to ſpeake.</p>
                  <p>The argument is not much unlike unto that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus, Acts</hi> 20.20. <hi>Yee know how I kept nothing backe with was profitable unto you but have ſhewed you and have taught you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The like argument to this which the Prophet here uſeth, to move attention, doth the Apoſtle uſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>His grace which was beſtowed upon me, was not in vaine but</hi> I <hi>laboured,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And his ſpirit]</hi> Many of the ancients doe interpret this <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> the <hi>third</hi> perſon in the bleſſed Trinity; But yet becauſe the Scripture ſpeakes often of God as of a man by an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.

                  <p>This is the third argument by which the Prophet would move attention, and how powerfull an argument this is; <hi>Eglon</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi> may ſhew, who when <hi>Ehud</hi> ſaid unto him: <hi>I have a meſſage from God unto thee; Eglon</hi> aroſe preſently out of his Seat: <hi>Judges</hi> 3.20. which argument is the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when it is enforced with the love of God.</p>

                  <p>As the <hi>mouth</hi> of the Prophet was likened to a <hi>ſharpe Sword</hi> a little before: So is he himſelfe here likened to a <hi>poliſhed ſhaft</hi> or <hi>Arrow,</hi> and that for the ſame reaſon, <hi>to wit</hi> becauſe of the <hi>word</hi> of God which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him in charge, which <hi>word</hi> as it was compared to a <hi>Sword</hi> before, ſo it is here compared to an <hi>Arrow,</hi> becauſe as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row pierceth the heart, So doth the word of God. And as an <hi>Arrow</hi> killeth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth: So doth the word of God kill and deſtroy ſinne and errour.</p>
                  <p>If there be any difference here between the meaning of the <hi>Sword</hi> and the <hi>Arrow,</hi> it conſiſteth in this, that the <hi>mouth of the Prophet</hi> is called a <hi>Sword,</hi> becauſe of the word which he had to ſpeake to the <hi>Jewes</hi> who were neere to him; for a <hi>Sword</hi> is a weapon that is uſed againſt thoſe that are nigh at hand: And he is called <hi>a Shaft</hi> or an <hi>Arrow,</hi> becauſe of the word which he had to ſpeake to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> who were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from him: for a <hi>Shaft</hi> or an <hi>Arrow</hi> is a weapon which is uſed at a diſtance.</p>

                     <hi>In his Quiver hath he hid me] i. e.</hi> He will hide me, from thoſe which perſecute me: and keepe me ſafe from their fury.</p>

                     <hi>In a day of ſalvation have I helped thee,] q. d.</hi> And thou haſt prayed to me for help againſt thine Enemies, in a day, as it were, of ſalvation; and I have granted thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, for I will help thee againſt them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In a day of ſalvation]</hi> What he calleth an <hi>acceptable time</hi> before, he calls a <hi>day of ſalvation</hi> here: and he calls it <hi>a day of ſalvation,</hi> in alluſion to the day in which a King had received ſome great ſalvation and deliverance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Have I helped thee,] i. e.</hi> I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to help thee.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Iſaiah</hi> did pray unto God at this time, is intimated in that, that God ſaith that he had heard him.</p>
                  <p>But what was it which he prayed for?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We may gather from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, what he prayed for: That therefore that he prayed for, was this; <hi>Firſt,</hi> That it would pleaſe <hi>God</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him, and keep him ſafe from his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which were many, until he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Miniſtry. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it would pleale him ſo to bleſs his Miniſtry, about which he was ſent, that thereby the people of <hi>the Jews,</hi> which were carryed into <hi>Babylon</hi> by reaſon of their ſins, might be reduced to their obedience, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, and return ſafe into their own Land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>It may be here objected, That <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was dead long before the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; how therefore could he reduce the captive <hi>Jews</hi> to their obedience, and ſo bring them out of captivity again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though <hi>Iſaiah</hi> were dead a long time before the captivity of <hi>the Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> yet may he be ſaid to reduce them to obedi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nce, and ſo bring them out of captivity again; becauſe they were redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to their obedience by the reading of his Writings, which he, by a Prophetique Spirit, wrought for them, and to them: and when they returned to their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Lord raiſed up <hi>Cyrus</hi> to deliver them out of captivity, and ſend them home free. So was <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to teach, and to be a Maſter, (<hi>Mark</hi> 10.3. <hi>&amp; Joh.</hi> 9.28.) though he was dead long before.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Jews</hi> in their captivity had theſe Prophecies and Writings of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> among them, and read them, and believed them, and were bettered by them, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by that, that they ſhewed <hi>Cyrus</hi> out of them thoſe things that concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; by which he was not a little moved to deliver them, and ſend them home free out of captivity.</p>
                  <p>That which is here ſpoken of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is in a more ſublime ſence ſpoken alſo of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as well appears 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. of whom <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was here a Type. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Iſaiah</hi> prayed to God, that He would preſerve him againſt his Enemies, that they might not deſtroy him, until he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed his Miniſtry, and God heard him: So did Chriſt pray, that God the Father would ſave him <hi>from death, and was heard in that he feared, Heb.</hi> 5.7. And as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was a <hi>Covenant</hi> to the people, and prayed that the <hi>Jews</hi> might be delivered out of their captivity by his Miniſtry, and was heard: So was Chriſt a <hi>Covenant</hi> to the people (in that he was the Mediator of the new Covenant between God and man,) and he makes continual interceſſion for us, that we may be delivered out of the power of darkneſs, and come to his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. and is heard in this his interceſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I will preſerve thee,] i. e.</hi> For I will preſerve thee out of the hands of thine Enemies, ſo that they ſhall not deſtroy thee, until thou haſt finiſhed my work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And give thee for a Covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,] i. e.</hi> And I will make thee a Reſtorer or Reviver of the Covenant, which was between my people and me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a Covenant of the people,</hi> becauſe he was the Reſtorer or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viver of the Covenant, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their God.</p>
                  <p>But how did <hi>Iſaiah</hi> reſtore or revive the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which was between the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their God?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> He did it by his Sermons to the <hi>Jews:</hi> For whereas <hi>the Jews</hi> had broken and forſaken the <hi>Covenant</hi> which they had made with God, by their ſins, and were therefore ſent into captivity. By reading of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Sermons they were touched in heart, and repented them of their ſins, and renewed their <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, as they had done before this in the days of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and as they did after this in the days of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi>

                  <p>Upon the repentance of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and their renewing their Covenant with the Lord, the Lord would not deſtroy the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> but preſerve it for the <hi>Jews</hi> to dwell in: Wherefore becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> repented, and renewed their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant by <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Miniſtry, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is ſaid <hi>to eſtabliſh the Earth,</hi> that is, <hi>the Land of Judah.</hi>

                  <p>In the 18, 19, 20, verſes the Lord aſſured <hi>Sion</hi> that her children ſhould come to her, to comfort her.

                  <p>This phraſe is the ſame for ſenſe with that which went immediately before: but he alludes herein, to a Captaine, which ſets up his Standard for his ſouldiers to

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:101476:210"/> deliver them, though they were <hi>captives</hi> and <hi>a prey,</hi> out of the hands of <hi>the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible</hi> and <hi>mighty,</hi> Cap. 49.25. and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to a former Objection of theirs, had told them, That <hi>they had ſold themſelves for their ſins,</hi> and <hi>that their mother was put away for their tranſgreſſions,</hi> verſ. 1.

                  <p>To this he anſwers, That the reaſon why he did not deliver them long ſince, was, becauſe <hi>he came unto them, and none of them would receive him; and he called to them, and none would anſwer him.</hi> And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they had <hi>received</hi> him, and <hi>anſwered</hi> him, and <hi>repented,</hi> and <hi>amended</hi> their lives, he would not deliver them: The reaſon was not, becauſe he wanted power and ability to deliver them; for he had power and ability to deliver them, as he ſheweth in the next words.</p>
                  <p>Note, that the Lord anſwers this their Objection in an <hi>interrogatory</hi> manner, to make it more tart for their obſtinate and pervicacious ſpirits.</p>

                     <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is it which is meant by them?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning is, as if he ſhould ſay, that I may <hi>put a new face on things,</hi> and make the Heavens to give their light, and the Earth to flouriſh and be verdant, as when they were <hi>at firſt created;</hi> that is, That I may bring back all joy and gladneſs into the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> where there is now ſorrow and grief, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of which ſence, note, that the Scripture ſaith of the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens</hi> in times of great calamity that they are <hi>darkened,</hi> and that the Stars of Heaven <hi>give not their light,</hi> neither doth the Sun and the Moon cauſe their their <hi>light to ſhine;</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> 50.30. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.10.

Therefore to make <hi>new</hi> Heavens, is to make the Heavens to give their light as brightly and as clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:101476:214"/> as when they were at firſt created, and that ſignifieth to give or reduce great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and great joy.</p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Earth,</hi> during the time of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> was accounted as a Wilderneſs, and as a Deſart, becauſe of the barrenneſs and ſqualidity thereof, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. When therefore the Lord ſaith, that he will lay the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Earth, his meaning is, that he will make the Earth to flouriſh, and be as verdant as when it was at firſt created; and that ſignifieth, that he will take away that barrenneſs and ſqualidity under which the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> lay during the captivity, and make it as <hi>Eden,</hi> yea, even as the Garden of the Lord, as it was at the firſt Creation, (as is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.)</p>
                  <p>Where note, that by <hi>the Heavens</hi> are particularly here meant the <hi>Heavens, which were over the Land of Judah,</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> 5.30. And by <hi>the Earth</hi> is particularly meant <hi>the Land of Judah,</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> 24.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that by a <hi>Synecdoche.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By this therefore that the Lord ſaith, That <hi>he will plant the Heavens,</hi> and <hi>lay the foundations of the Earth,</hi> is meant, that he will make the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> a joyful and a fruitful Land.</p>
                  <p>But it may be here asked, How it is to be underſtood that the Lord here ſaith, that he <hi>put his words into Iſaiabs mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that he the Lord might plant the Heavens, and lay the foundations of the Earth; that is,</hi> That he the Lord might give great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and joy to the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and make the Land of <hi>Judah</hi> a joyful and a fruitful Land?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> As the Lord took away all proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and joy out of the Land of <hi>Judah,</hi> and made it a barren and a doleful Land, becauſe of the ſins of the <hi>Jews</hi> which dwelt therein; ſo he was determined to reduce all joy and proſperity into it, and to make it a fruitful and a flouriſhing Land again, if the <hi>Jews</hi> would repent them of their ſins. That therefore they might be induced to repent, he put his words into <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> mouth, and covered him with the ſhadow of his hand, that upon his words they might repent, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their repentance he the Lord might bring back all joy and fruitfulneſs into the Land of <hi>Judah.</hi> And thus is the Lord ſaid to put his words into <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> mouth, that <hi>he the Lord might plant the Heavens, and lay the foundations of the Earth.</hi>

                     <hi>Theſe two things are come unto thee, &amp;c.]</hi> Here in this Verſe he ſheweth what was meant by the <hi>cup of trembling,</hi> and the <hi>cup</hi> of the Lords fury, mentioned Verſ. 17.</p>
                  <p>Note here the <hi>Enallage</hi> of change of perſon again, how he returns again from the <hi>third</hi> to the <hi>ſecond</hi> perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Who ſhall be ſorry for thee?] i. e.</hi> Who ſhall pity thy caſe? <hi>q. d.</hi> And there is none to pity thee.</p>
                  <p>Pity is a grief or ſorrow, conceived at another mans miſery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſolation and deſtruction, and the famine and the ſword:] q. d.</hi> Deſolation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, <hi>that is,</hi> the famine and the ſword.</p>
                  <p>Note, that that middle Particle, <hi>And,</hi> is a Note of declaration or explication, and ſignifieth as much as, <hi>that is.</hi> For the <hi>two things</hi> which he ſaith are come unto <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> are the Famine and the Sword; but he nameth them twice: for <hi>deſolation</hi> and <hi>famine</hi> are the ſame, and <hi>deſtruction</hi> and the <hi>ſword</hi> are the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſolation]</hi> By <hi>deſolation</hi> is meant <hi>famine</hi> here, <hi>per Metonymiam Effectus,</hi> becauſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine cauſeth a deſolation in Cities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Deſtruction]</hi> By Deſtruction is meant the Sword, <hi>per Metonymiam Effectus,</hi> becauſe the Sword worketh deſtruction, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth whitherſoever it cometh.</p>
                  <p>Note, that becauſe it could not well be underſtood what he meant by <hi>deſolation
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:101476:215"/> and deſtruction</hi> in this place, therefore he adds <hi>the famine and the ſword,</hi> to explain his meaning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By whom ſhall I comfort thee?] q. d.</hi> And yet there is no man to comfort thee: For as for the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> they reproach thee, and revile thee, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. and uſe all cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to thee, <hi>cap.</hi> 47.6. And as for thine own children, they are in as ſad condition as thy ſelf, and are not able to afford thee any comfort; for <hi>they have fainted, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is ſome eaſe to one in miſery to have ſome body to pity him, and to think that he hath ſome friends left to comfort him: but to know that there is none to pity, nor a friend left to comfort, this breaks the very heart.</p>

                  <p>He changeth the perſon here, and ſpeaks of <hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the <hi>third</hi> perſon, to whom he ſpoke in the foregoing words in the <hi>ſecond;</hi> and he uſeth a <hi>preſent</hi> for a <hi>future</hi> tenſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sion</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called <hi>deſolate,</hi> and <hi>as one forſaken of her Husband,</hi> becauſe God (who was her Husband, <hi>verſ.</hi> 5. and <hi>cap.</hi> 62.5.) had forſaken her, <hi>cap.</hi> 50.1. And therefore, as a woman which is <hi>deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> and <hi>forſaken</hi> of her Husband beareth not children; ſo was <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> barren, and without children, while God had forſaken her; who might be called her Husband, as in other regards, ſo in this, that while he had a favor to her, he did encreaſe her children within her, as a woman multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth her children by her Husband.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then the children of the marryed wife.] i. e.</hi> Then thy children were, when thou hadſt an Husband, any time heretofore, and waſt a marryed Wife.</p>
                  <p>The meaning is, that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> though ſhe had been afflicted, and brought into captivity by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> and had her Children or Citizens carryed away from her; yet now ſhe ſhould be more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous then ever ſhe was at any time before that her captivity.</p>
                  <p>Note, that when he ſaith, <hi>More are the children of the deſolate, then the children of the marryed woman,</hi> he ſpeaks as though he ſpoke of two ſeveral perſons; but he ſpeaks but of two ſeveral ſtates or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the ſame perſon. So we ſay of a man that is changed from what he was, that he is <hi>another man,</hi> though not <hi>his ſubſtance,</hi> but <hi>his condition</hi> onely is changed.</p>
                  <p>This which I have given, is the firſt ſence of this place: But <hi>Sion</hi> here (as ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came fruitful after her widowhood) was a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>Church of Chriſt:</hi> So that, in the ſecond and ſublime ſence, this place is to be underſtood of the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> as will appear <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.27. For as <hi>Sion,</hi> while God had put her away from being his Wife, and had given her over to be ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hands of the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> was barren, and brought forth no children; but when he took her to him to Wife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſhe encreaſed in children as the Stars of Heaven for multitude: So the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> while ſhe was a ſtranger to the bed of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and was without the <hi>ſeed</hi> of his Word, (<hi>that is,</hi> while <hi>all Nations were ſuffered to walk in their own ways, Acts</hi> 14.16. and were given over to the god of this World to be blinded by him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30.) brought forth no children unto God: But when Chriſt took her to his bed, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.29. and redeemed her out
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:101476:225"/> of the hand of Satan, and gave her the <hi>ſeed</hi> of his Word, ſhe ſo encreaſed in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as that all the ends of the Earth were full of her iſſue: So that ſhe far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the <hi>Synagogue of the Iews,</hi> when it was moſt populous.</p>
                  <p>Note here, that <hi>Sion,</hi> as ſhe was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, was a Type of the <hi>Synagogue of the Iews:</hi> but, as ſhe was conſidered <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, was a Type of the <hi>Church of Chriſt.</hi> As therefore <hi>Sion</hi> was more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <hi>after</hi> the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, then ever ſhe was <hi>before;</hi> ſo was the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> more populous, then ever the <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of the Iews</hi> was.</p>
                  <p>Wonder not that I make <hi>Sion</hi> a Type of the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Sion</hi> a Type of the <hi>Church,</hi> upon divers conſiderations; For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes her a Type of the <hi>Synagogue, Gal.</hi> 4.25. and a Type of the <hi>Church, Rom.</hi> 9.33.</p>
                  <p>It may be objected here, That the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> was not the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> before <hi>Chriſt</hi> marryed her; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> was never bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> We call all Nations the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> out of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> took his <hi>Church:</hi> For all Nations were the Church of Chriſt <hi>materially,</hi> and <hi>in potentia,</hi> before he actually marryed them. Again, by a <hi>Prolepſis</hi> or <hi>Anticipation,</hi> That may be ſaid to be, which is not yet, but onely ſhall be: The <hi>Church of Chriſt</hi> therefore might be called the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> before ſhe was actually marryed to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>

                  <p>As <hi>barrenneſs</hi> was a <hi>ſhame</hi> and <hi>reproach</hi> to women in general, ſo muſt it have been a greater ſhame and reproach to a woman to have been barren in <hi>her youth,</hi> and in the <hi>flower</hi> of her days, then to have been ſo in her <hi>old</hi> and <hi>decaying</hi> age.</p>

                  <p>A wife which is naught and playeth the Harlot in her youth, proveth the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious ſtrumpet of all; For luſt reigneth in her more than it doth in the aged, and her affections are hotter and more unbride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                  <p>That the Lord ſhould call <hi>Sion,</hi> when ſhe was <hi>as a woman forſaken and grieved in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſpeakes the great goodneſſe and loving kindneſſe of the Lord to her; for ſuch a woman ſeldome findeth friends: But that he ſhould call her again, and make her his wife when ſhe had played the <hi>Harlot</hi> in <hi>her youth,</hi> and he had <hi>put her</hi> away for her whoredomes, ſpeakes yet his greater good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and loving kindneſſe.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The mercies</hi> which are here called <hi>the mercies of David,</hi> are thoſe mercies and bleſſings which <hi>David</hi> ſo often ſpeaks of in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and which are there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, in the Name of God, to all which ſerve and fear him, and lead a godly life, whether they be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles;</hi> as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.15. and 37. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 11. and 84.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Promiſes, being made in <hi>general</hi> terms to them which fear God, and lead a godly life, are made as well to the <hi>Gentile</hi> as to the <hi>Jew,</hi> as we may gather from St. <hi>Pauls</hi> arguing from that <hi>general</hi> word, <hi>Whoſoever, Rom.</hi> 10.11.</p>
                  <p>But why are theſe called <hi>the mercies of David?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe they are ſo often repeated in the Book or Pſalms of <hi>David;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were made upon the particular occaſion of <hi>Davids</hi> fear and truſt in God; and becauſe <hi>David</hi> had had often experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them.</p>
                  <p>But why are they called the <hi>ſure</hi> mercies of <hi>David?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Becauſe they ſhall be certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; for God who hath promiſed them is faithful in his Word, and will therefore perform them, becauſe he hath ſaid it.</p>
                  <p>Note here, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Reſurrection of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead, brings this as an argument to prove, that <hi>God raiſed Chriſt from the dead now no more to return to corruption; to wit,</hi> that the Lord ſaid (to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> here in <hi>Iſaiah) I will give you the ſure mercies of David, Acts</hi> 13.34. And a great queſtion it is, how <hi>Paul</hi> can prove the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Chriſt</hi> from the dead, and ſo as not to dye again, from theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> Theſe words, <hi>I will give you the ſure mercies of David,</hi> as in the firſt ſence they ſignifie thoſe temporal and corporeal bleſſings, with which God would reward all that ſerved him, and feared him, in the time of the Law: So, in the ſecond and ſublime ſence, they ſignifie thoſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal bleſſings, with which God would reward all them which ſerved him in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the time of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; the former being a <hi>type</hi> of the latter. Now Saint <hi>Paul</hi> draweth his Argument from theſe words, as they are taken in the ſecond and ſublime, not as they are taken in the firſt ſence.</p>
                  <p>But how can he draw ſuch an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from theſe words, though he takes them in the ſecond and ſublime ſence?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> For anſwer to this, we muſt know, that God ſent his Son <hi>Jeſus,</hi> while he lived on Earth, onely to the <hi>Jews,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.24. and again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5. And the Goſpel was not ſo much as to be preached to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> till after Chriſts death, as appeareth <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 20, 23, 32. nay, not till after his Reſurrection, <hi>Matt.</hi> 28.19. no, not till after his Aſcenſion; for the Apoſtles were to tarry at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> until they were endued with power from on high, <hi>that is,</hi> until they had received the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.49. and they could not receive the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> till <hi>Chriſt</hi> had aſcended up to his Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.3, 7. Which things premiſed, it is plain, that the Reſurrection of Chriſt may be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refragably proved from thoſe words of God to the believing <hi>Gentiles, I will give you the ſure mercies of David;</hi> for the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> could not receive thoſe mercies, nor had they any title to them, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and they could not believe, except they had heard the Goſpel; and they could not hear without a Preacher, and none could preach before he was ſent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 15. and none could be ſent, until <hi>Chriſt</hi> were riſen from the dead, and was aſcended into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But though <hi>Chriſts</hi> Reſurrection from the dead may be proved from theſe words, how can it be proved from theſe words, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould never dye again after he was riſen?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The temporal Salvation which was promiſed in the Old Teſtament, was a <hi>type</hi> of the eternal Salvation which is promiſed in the New Teſtament: And as in the firſt ſence, <hi>temporal ſalvation</hi> is one of the mercies which God ſaith he will here give to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that would know his Name, in the time of the Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.17, 19, 20, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So, in the ſecond ſence,

                  <p>Note here, that <hi>a portion</hi> ſignifieth often in Scripture an <hi>inheritance,</hi> in alluſion to that diviſion which was made of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> when it was divided into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts or portions, and thoſe ſeveral parts and portion were given for ſeveral inheritances to the ſeveral Tribes and Families of <hi>Iſrael, Joſh.</hi> 13, &amp;c.

                  <p>Note here again, that whereas he ſaith, <hi>Among the ſmooth ſtones of the ſtream is thy portion;</hi> it is not to be underſtood by theſe words, that Idolaters ſet up their Idols <hi>in the ſtreams,</hi> or <hi>in the rivers,</hi> (for certainly they did not ſet them up in the rivers, or in the ſtreams,) but onely that they ſet them up nigh unto the rivers or ſtreams, upon the ſhoars thereof; upon which ſhoars, becauſe there were many <hi>ſtones</hi> caſt up by the inundation of the rivers at ſome times, theſe Idols might be ſaid to have been ſet up, or ſtand, or be among <hi>the ſtones of the ſtream.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why then did not the Prophet ſay, <hi>Nigh to the rivers,</hi> or <hi>ſtream,</hi> or <hi>waters, is thy portion?</hi> but, <hi>Among the ſmooth ſtones of the ſtream is thy portion?</hi>

                  <p>Note once again, that here he ſpeaketh to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereas he ſpoke before to the <hi>Jews,</hi> for he changeth both the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and the Gender; and he ſpeaks to her as to a woman, by a <hi>Proſopopoeia;</hi> yet in her he ſets out the condition and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of the <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves.</p>

                  <p>The voice or ſound of a <hi>Trumpet</hi> is loud and may be heard afarre off; Therefore he bids him, lift up his voyce like a Trumpet: And they had need to lift up their voice like a <hi>Trumpet</hi> and ſpeak aloud to ſinners who are to tell them of their ſinnes; For ſinners are deafe on that eare.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words contain a reaſon why God, though they faſted, yet would not ſee; and though they afflicted their ſouls, yet would take no knowledge of it.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Note, that upon the tenth day of the ſeventh month there was to be <hi>a day of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement,</hi> it was to be an <hi>holy convocation</hi> to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they were to <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict their ſoules,</hi> and <hi>to offer an offering made by fire unto the Lord, &amp;c. Levit.</hi> 23.27. And it is not to be doubted, but that the <hi>Jews</hi> which would ſeem religious, did obſerve this day yeerely in the Land of their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and <hi>afflict their ſoules</hi> therein, though they did not offer an offering made by fire, or perform ſuch duties of that day as were bound to the Temple. And of this <hi>day of Faſt</hi> (though not onely, yet) prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally doe I think that this place is here meant.</p>
                  <p>Upon the day of <hi>Atonement,</hi> which was a day of Faſting and humiliation, no work was to be done, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25.31. Neither was it ſeemly upon the daies of voluntary Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</p>

                  <p>Again, when the Lord ſaith, <hi>If thou do theſe things,</hi> then ſhall thy light break forth as the morning: By <hi>theſe things</hi> may be meant, not <hi>theſe things in ſpecial,</hi> but <hi>theſe things in general.</hi> So when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had commanded Servants to be <hi>obedient to them that are their Maſters according to the fleſh with fear and trembling, &amp;c.</hi> he adds, <hi>Ye Maſters do the ſame things to them, Eph.</hi> 6.9. where we cannot underſtand the <hi>ſame things</hi> of the <hi>ſame things in ſpecial,</hi> but of the <hi>ſame things in general.</hi> The like we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. verſ. 1.</p>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:101476:243"/> for meat, doth the Prophet here allude: And by this, that <hi>he that eateth of the Cockatrice eggs dyeth,</hi> is meant, That they which meddle with miſchievous matters, bring miſchief upon their own heads.</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, That no man will eat <hi>Cockatrice eggs</hi> for food?</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> True; therefore this alluſion to the <hi>eating of eggs for food,</hi> is <hi>Catachreſtical;</hi> yet it is an alluſion to that ſtill, <hi>to wit,</hi> to the eating of eggs, as we eat them for food.</p>
                  <p>Note, that this <hi>Metaphor</hi> varyeth from that which is uſed in thoſe words, <hi>They hatch Cockatrice eggs,</hi> though in ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars it agreeth with it.</p>

                  <p>This is a proverbial kinde of ſpeech too, and ſignifieth the ſame with that which went immediately before, <hi>to wit,</hi> That they which meddle with miſchievous devices, receive miſchief thereby.</p>
                  <p>Note, that they which uſe to deal often with eggs, do ſometimes <hi>cruſh</hi> an egg a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their will, and break it; and to this doth the Prophet ſeem here to allude.</p>
                  <p>But how can a <hi>Cockatrice egg,</hi> being cruſhed, break out into a <hi>Viper,</hi> or bring forth a <hi>Viper;</hi> for the <hi>Cockatrice</hi> and <hi>Viper</hi> are different beaſts, of different <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies?</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The duty of the <hi>ſpirituall watchmen</hi> is to labour and promote the ſafety of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple over which he is ſet, which he doth partly by advertizing them of their ſinnes, when he ſeeth them in danger thereof,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:101476:255"/> partly by praying to God for them.</p>

                     <hi>For behold I create new Heavens, and a new Earth,]</hi> He confirmeth here what he ſaid in the former Verſe, <hi>to wit,</hi> That the former troubles ſhould be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and hid from his eyes.</p>
                  <p>When he ſaith, that he would <hi>create new Heavens, and a new Earth,</hi> the meaning is, That he would make a new face and ſtate of things, far more happy, and more glorious and deſirable, then what his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants did now enjoy: He would bring them out of ſuch a depth of miſery to ſuch an height of happineſs, as that they ſhould think themſelves to be in a new world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I create new Heavens,]</hi> The Lord ſaith that he would create <hi>new Heavens,</hi> becauſe he would make the <hi>Heavens</hi> brighter then they were at this time: For whereas they were now <hi>black</hi> and <hi>cloudy</hi> and <hi>lowring,</hi> he would make them <hi>bright</hi> and <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>full of light;</hi> ſo that they ſhould appear <hi>as new Heavens.</hi>

                  <p>This is an expreſſion which the Holy Ghoſt often uſeth, when he would ſignifie joy and gladneſs, and an happy eſtate, which ſhould be given to thoſe which had been in miſery. And the ground of it ſeemeth to be, either this, That he makes the Heavens to ſympathize with men; and as to look <hi>black</hi> and <hi>dark</hi> when men are in <hi>miſery,</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> 5.30. ſo to <hi>ſhine</hi> out when they are in <hi>proſperity,</hi> as <hi>cap.</hi> 30.26. Or this, That to the man which is of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart all things ſeem pleaſant, whereas to him that is ſorrowful all things ſeem ſad; becauſe we receive and look upon things, not as <hi>they</hi> are in <hi>themſelves,</hi> but as <hi>we are affected,</hi> and as <hi>we</hi> are in <hi>our ſelves:</hi> When therefore God giveth a joyful heart, or that which may create joy, he may be ſaid <hi>to create new Heavens.</hi>

                  <p>Note here, that the Holy Ghoſt ſeemeth to uſe ſuch high expreſſions for ſuch mean things, becauſe ſuch mean things were types of greater things, yea ſuch things as

                     <hi>But the ſinner being an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed,]</hi> He prevents an Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here: For whereas God promiſeth here the bleſſing of <hi>long life</hi> onely unto his <hi>ſervants,</hi> and would have it taken as a peculiar bleſſing to them, ſo that the <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> ſhould have no part in it; It might be objected, That this is not ſuch a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and ſpecial bleſſing of the <hi>righteous,</hi> or of his <hi>ſervants,</hi> as he would make it to be; for the <hi>ſinners</hi> alſo fulfil their days, and live an hundred years.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> True it is, That God choſe <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons for <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the reſt of the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to miniſter to him under them, in the Tabernacle and Temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he brought the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> But as for thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> which dwelt among the <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> they were exceeding wicked, as the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> were; And therefore when the Lord would have <hi>no mercy upon the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, but utterly take them away, Hoſ.</hi> 1.6. and ſaid unto them, <hi>Ye are not my people, and I will not be your God, Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. As he rejected the <hi>whole people</hi> from being <hi>his people;</hi> ſo he rejected thoſe of the <hi>Tribe of Levi,</hi> which dwelt among them, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites to him:</hi> Yea, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid to the ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> which dwelt among <hi>them, Becauſe ye have rejected knowledge, I will alſo reject you, that ye ſhall be no Prieſts to me, Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. And what he ſaid to them, we muſt underſtand of the <hi>Levites</hi> alſo, that they ſhould not miniſter any more to him. Now if God, when he had thus rejected all the ſons of <hi>Aaron</hi> which dwelt among the <hi>ten Tribes</hi> from being <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the reſt of the ſons of <hi>Levi</hi> from being <hi>Levites</hi> unto him, did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards accept of ſome of them for <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi> to himſelf, it was a new love, and a new kindneſs in the Lord to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.</p>

                  <p>Note, that our Saviour, ſpeaking of Hell, maketh mention of theſe words, ſaying, <hi>Where the worm dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched, Mark</hi> 9.44. alluding no doubt to this place of our Prophet, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>But why doth our Saviour do this? Why doth he quote this place, when he ſpeaks of the <hi>everlaſting</hi> puniſhment of Hell, when our Prophet ſpeaketh thereby of the <hi>temporal</hi> puniſhment of thoſe which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt God?</p>
